4805,Illinois gets federal grant to improve maternal health.,"Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth say the Illinois Department of Public Health will use the funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to review maternal deaths and find opportunities for prevention. The U.S. maternal and infant mortality rate has been rising, especially for women and babies of color. A state review found African-American women in Illinois are six times more likely to die of pregnancy-related complications than white women. About 72% of Illinois’ pregnancy-related deaths were preventable. Durbin says “no nation as rich and advanced as the United States” should have moms and infants dying at rates the U.S. is seeing.","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact communities worldwide, experts are urging people to remain vigilant and adhere to safety guidelines. Vaccinations have offered a glimmer of hope, but recent data suggests that it is crucial to maintain precautions even after receiving the vaccine.

COVID-19 vaccines have been developed at an unprecedented pace, providing protection against severe illness and hospitalization. However, emerging evidence shows that while the vaccines greatly reduce the risk of infection, they may not prevent transmission entirely. This revelation highlights the necessity of ongoing preventive measures such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and frequent hand hygiene, even among those who have been vaccinated.

Several studies have demonstrated that breakthrough infections can occur among fully vaccinated individuals. These are cases where individuals contract the virus despite being fully vaccinated. Although breakthrough infections tend to be milder compared to unvaccinated cases, these individuals can still spread the virus to others, including vulnerable populations.

A recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections have similar viral loads in their airways as unvaccinated individuals. This indicates that they are capable of transmitting the virus to others. While the likelihood of transmission is significantly lower among vaccinated individuals, it is imperative to exercise caution, especially in settings with high rates of community transmission.

Dr. Sarah Johnson, an infectious disease specialist, emphasizes, ""Vaccines are a critical tool in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and reducing its severity. However, they are not a silver bullet. We need to continue practicing preventive measures to protect ourselves and those around us.""

Experts explain that several factors contribute to breakthrough infections and potential transmission, including new variants and waning immunity over time. As new variants emerge, some may exhibit increased resistance to certain vaccines, thereby posing a higher risk of breakthrough infections. Consequently, efforts to monitor and address the evolving landscape of COVID-19 variants are essential in curbing the potential spread.

Furthermore, studies suggest that while vaccines provide robust protection initially, the effectiveness may decrease over time. This does not mean that vaccinations lose their efficacy entirely; booster shots or additional doses may be required in the future to ensure long-term immunity against new variants and to bolster waning immunity. Scientists and vaccine manufacturers are closely monitoring these developments to update vaccines accordingly.

Public health officials continue to emphasize the importance of a multi-faceted approach to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination plays a significant role, but it must be accompanied by continued adherence to preventive measures, especially in high-risk scenarios such as crowded indoor settings or areas with low vaccination rates.

In conclusion, receiving a COVID-19 vaccine significantly reduces the risk of severe illness and hospitalization. However, breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals can occur, underscoring the importance of ongoing preventive measures. The development and spread of new variants, along with potential waning immunity over time, require vigilance and flexibility in tackling this global health crisis. By staying informed, practicing precautionary measures, and following guidance from public health authorities, we will navigate through this pandemic and protect our communities.",true
3454,"Immigrant still hospitalized in Iowa, 18 months after crash.","Jean-Claude Shako suffered head and other injuries in the June 25, 2018, collision while he and four other immigrants from the Democratic Republic of Congo were headed to work at a meatpacking plant in Tama. The collision with a construction vehicle also injured both drivers and a fifth person in the car carrying Shako, according to The Gazette. Shako’s severe brain trauma has impaired his mobility, speech and memory. He’s well enough to be discharged from the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics, doctors have said, but he has no family to move in with, no money for a rehabilitation center and isn’t yet eligible for assistance through Medicaid. “I’m getting stronger,” Shako told the newspaper through an interpreter last week. “If my family would take me, I would go. But I don’t have family here.” He has been granted permanent U.S. residency. He carries in his wallet pictures of his wife and five children, who remain in Congo. Hospital officials cite privacy rules in declining to answer questions about Shako and about why the hospital hadn’t subsidized a move to a lower-cost skilled nursing facility. In fiscal 2018, the hospital provided free care for 14,548 patients and absorbing costs of $14.2 million, according to Iowa Hospital Association figures. Shako’s friend and co-legal guardian Peter Nkumu, of Iowa City, has been scrambling to find help for him, including asking lawmakers to consider waiving a wait rule for legal immigrants wanting access to Medicaid. State Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, an Ottumwa Republican, said she plans to inquire about Shako’s case and said lawmakers might be willing — in extreme circumstances — to consider exceptions to the five-year wait rule. But Miller-Meeks also said she wants to make sure other avenues and options are considered, such as stringent insurance requirements for legal immigrants. Nkumu and other immigrants have explored trying to bring someone from Congo to support Shako, but visas are tough to come by. Shako received one of 2,664 permanent visas issued to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2017, according to the U.S. State Department. They fear sending Shako back to Congo, saying the poor conditions there could be prove fatal to him. Geoffrey Lauer, executive director of the Iowa Brain Injury Alliance based in Iowa City, said getting Shako out of the hospital and into a more appropriate setting not only would save state resources, it could accelerate his rehabilitation. And, Lauer said, Shako now is an Iowan, making him “part of our mission.”","COVID-19 Vaccine Boosters Show Promise in Boosting Immunity

With the ongoing fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of new variants and concerns about waning immunity have prompted scientists to explore the potential benefits of booster shots. Recent studies indicate that COVID-19 vaccine boosters can effectively enhance immune responses, providing hope for controlling the spread of the virus and preventing severe illness.

Researchers around the world, including those from leading pharmaceutical companies and independent institutions, have been evaluating the effectiveness of booster shots for different COVID-19 vaccines. Their findings suggest that administering a supplementary dose significantly increases antibody levels, particularly against the worrisome Delta variant.

A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine analyzed data from over 3,000 healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia who had received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Results revealed that individuals who received a third booster shot showed an approximate fivefold increase in neutralizing antibodies against the Delta variant compared to those without the additional dose.

Similarly, Israeli researchers published a study in Nature Medicine, reporting positive outcomes after administering a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to fully vaccinated individuals aged 60 and above. The study included nearly 150 participants and demonstrated that the booster shot significantly enhanced antibody responses and improved cellular immune responses, indicating increased protection against the virus.

Moderna, another prominent vaccine manufacturer, also shared encouraging findings regarding booster shots. An interim analysis of their ongoing clinical trial highlighted that administration of a half-dose booster effectively increased antibody levels against multiple variants, including Delta and Beta.

Furthermore, real-world data from the United States has provided additional evidence supporting the use of booster shots. Reportedly, a growing number of individuals are seeking additional doses due to concerns about waning immunity and the increasing prevalence of the Delta variant. Early analysis indicates that these booster shots may strengthen the immune system and make breakthrough infections less likely.

While the effectiveness of boosters in enhancing immunity is becoming clearer, the discussion on timing and prioritization remains a topic of debate. Some experts argue that administering booster shots to a broader population could help maintain robust protection, while others suggest focusing on vulnerable groups such as the elderly and immunocompromised individuals.

Public health authorities and regulatory bodies worldwide are closely monitoring the latest research to guide their decision-making about booster shot distribution. The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized the need for global equity in vaccine distribution, urging countries to prioritize sharing doses with low-income nations to ensure equal access to protection.

It is worth noting that vaccine booster shots are not a definitive solution against COVID-19. While they play a crucial role in boosting immunity, adhering to preventive measures such as wearing masks, practicing good hand hygiene, and maintaining social distancing should remain integral components of any strategy to combat the virus.

The implications of COVID-19 vaccine boosters extend beyond individual protection. By reducing the likelihood of transmission and breakthrough infections, boosters may contribute to achieving higher levels of community immunity, commonly known as herd immunity. This, in turn, can alleviate the burden on healthcare systems and expedite the return to normalcy.

As scientists continue to study the long-term effectiveness and durability of COVID-19 vaccines, booster shots offer a promising tool in our ongoing battle against the pandemic. Timely administration of booster shots, coupled with responsible public health measures, provides an optimistic outlook for controlling the spread of the virus and protecting vulnerable populations.",true
8530,"Global coronavirus death toll hits 100,000, cases over 1.6 million.","The first death came in the central Chinese city of Wuhan on Jan. 9. It took 83 days for the first 50,000 deaths to be recorded and just eight more for the toll to climb to 100,000. The toll has been accelerating at a daily rate of between 6% and 10% over the past week, and there were almost 7,300 deaths globally reported on Thursday. The death toll now compares with that of London’s Great Plague in the mid-1660s, which killed an estimated 100,000 people, about a third of the city’s population at the time. But it is still far short of the so-called Spanish flu, which began in 1918 and is estimated to have killed more than 20 million people by the time it petered out in 1920. The novel coronavirus is believed to have emerged in a Wuhan market where wild animals were sold late last year. It quickly spread through China and around the world. Much remains to be determined about it, including just how lethal it is. Estimates vary widely. Friday’s figures - 100,000 deaths of out 1.6 million cases - would suggest a fatality rate of 6.25% but many experts believe the actual rate is lower given that many mild and asymptomatic cases, when infected people don’t show symptoms, are not included in case totals. Some countries, including Italy, France, Algeria, the Netherlands, Spain and Britain are reporting that more than 10% of all confirmed cases have been fatal. One of the largest studies of the fatality of the disease, involving 44,000 patients in China, put the rate at about 2.9%. The same study reported that 93% of recorded fatalities were people over the age of 50, and more than half were over 70. Despite that, there are growing numbers of young adults and teenagers included in the global toll. While North America now accounts for more than 30% of cases, Europe has reported a disproportionate number of fatalities, as countries with older populations like Spain and Italy have been severely affected. Southern Europe alone accounts for more than a third of global deaths, despite recording just 20% of cases. In many countries, official data includes only deaths reported in hospitals, not those in homes or nursing homes.

A new and highly concerning development has emerged in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. A variant of the virus, known as B.1.351, has been detected in South Africa, prompting urgent calls for a global response to this potential threat.

The B.1.351 variant, first identified in Nelson Mandela Bay in October 2020, has raised numerous concerns among scientists and public health officials. Similar to the variant discovered in the UK, this new strain appears to be more transmissible than the original virus. Preliminary data suggests that B.1.351 may spread at a rate of up to 50% faster than other strains, making containment efforts even more challenging.

Moreover, evidence indicates that the B.1.351 variant may have an impact on the effectiveness of certain COVID-19 vaccines. While research is ongoing, initial findings suggest that antibodies generated by previous COVID-19 infections or vaccinations may not be as effective against this variant. This raises significant concerns about the potential need for updated vaccines and the overall efficacy of existing immunization strategies.

Dr. Zweli Mkhize, South Africa's Minister of Health, expressed his urgency in addressing the situation. He warned that the B.1.351 variant could potentially render current vaccine efforts futile if not adequately addressed. As a result, South African health authorities have implemented strict measures to contain the spread of the variant within their borders.

However, given the global nature of the pandemic, a local approach alone will not suffice. International collaborations and coordinated efforts are now crucial to ensure that the B.1.351 variant does not spread further and compromise the progress made in controlling the virus.

Already, several countries have taken proactive measures to mitigate the risk associated with this particular strain. Travel restrictions and increased surveillance have been implemented to identify cases and prevent the importation of the B.1.351 variant. The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on governments and pharmaceutical companies to share scientific data and expedite the development of updated vaccines and treatments.

In response to these developments, vaccine manufacturers are closely evaluating the effectiveness of their products against the B.1.351 variant. Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech have initiated studies to assess whether their vaccines provide protection against this new strain. If necessary, these companies have expressed their ability to modify their vaccine compositions to target specific variants more effectively.

Additionally, global health leaders are urging the public to remain vigilant and adhere to public health measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and hand hygiene. While the B.1.351 variant raises concerns about vaccine effectiveness, it is crucial to remember that these preventive measures offer a level of protection against all strains of the virus.

The emergence of the B.1.351 variant underscores the need for ongoing vigilance and adaptability in our fight against COVID-19. This situation serves as a reminder that the virus continues to evolve and mutate, underscoring the importance of swift action and cooperation on a global scale.

Governments, health organizations, and pharmaceutical companies must work together to contain the spread of the B.1.351 variant and ensure that vaccines remain effective against emerging strains. With coordinated efforts and international solidarity, we can overcome this latest challenge in our battle against COVID-19, protecting lives and paving the way for a safer future.",true
7956,Coronavirus brings no-contact food delivery to United States.,"The virus led McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and other companies in China, where the outbreak originated, to broaden their use of contactless delivery last month as consumers were stuck at home, often in locked-off apartment complexes. Now, that concept is growing in other parts of the globe along with the illness. On Friday, San Francisco-based Postmates introduced no-contact delivery options in its app in all of the 4,200 U.S. cities in which it operates. “We think it is a way to make both customers and the fleet comfortable while making and receiving deliveries,” the company said in a statement. Postmates users got an email notifying them of the new service called Dropoff Options. Three choices pop up when a customer places an order - delivery to the door, leave it at the door, or meet the customer outside - for “whether you’re feeling under the weather or are working from home in your pjs,” the email said. Customers have also long been able to leave similar digital notes for delivery people via delivery platforms Grubhub Inc (GRUB.N) and Uber Technologies Inc’s (UBER.N) Uber Eats, which operates in 45 countries, when placing an order. DoorDash is also testing enhanced drop-off options for contactless delivery to be rolled out shortly and is reminding consumers that they can leave instructions for drivers in the app, which can include a photo of the spot where food should be placed. The COVID-19 virus has infected more than 111,600 and killed more than 4,000 people globally, largely in China, according to a Reuters tally. In the United States, more than 700 people have been infected and 27 people have died. Last week, new cases spread quickly from just a couple states to a majority of states. As more people consider staying home to limit exposure, restaurant traffic could take a hit. Technomic Inc, a consulting and research firm, found that more than 30% of U.S. consumers said they plan to not leave the house or go to restaurants as often, though only 13% of those people said they will order more delivery. The report surveyed 1,000 consumers from Feb. 28 to March 2. “The reduced foodservice visit incidence could be a boon for the grocery business, as almost half of these consumers say they will stockpile grocery foods and beverages as a substitute for away-from-home meals,” the firm said. In Europe, German supermarket chain REWE said that a significant increase in demand has led to longer online delivery times since it has limited delivery slots and drivers are already fully loaded. British online supermarket Ocado has advised customers to place orders further in advance because of “exceptionally high demand,” indicating a possible reaction from shoppers to the spreading coronavirus outbreak. Dutch online grocer Picnic BV has been getting more and larger orders and is “at about 20% beyond capacity,” Chief Executive Michiel Muller told broadcaster RTL. U.S. delivery companies contacted by Reuters will not say whether they are yet seeing any increase in demand. But one driver for DoorDash Inc in the Washington, D.C. area said his shifts had gotten busier. The driver, who did not want to be named, said his pay per delivery - which usually rises during busier times or bad weather - has also steadily gone up as coronavirus cases grew. His average pay per order rose from about $3.20 in mid-February to $4.72 during the last week of the month, though it was $4.37 during the first week of March, according to screenshots of his driving stats. People are scared to go to restaurants, he said. “So they’re paying $15 to $20 delivery fees for a small fry and an ice cream scoop,” he said.","Scientists Discover New COVID-19 Variant with Potential Vaccine Resistance

In a concerning development, scientists have identified a new variant of the coronavirus that may possess the ability to resist current COVID-19 vaccines. This revelation has sparked fears over the efficacy of existing vaccine campaigns and raises questions about the future trajectory of the pandemic.

The new variant, named B.1.526, was first detected in New York City in late 2020. Researchers have since found evidence of its presence in surrounding areas as well. Preliminary data suggests that this particular variant carries a mutation known as E484K, which is also found in other concerning variants like those originating in South Africa and Brazil. This specific mutation has been shown to reduce the neutralizing effects of antibodies generated by both natural infection and vaccination.

Scientists are now urgently studying the potential impact of B.1.526 on vaccine effectiveness. While these findings are undoubtedly worrying, it remains unclear whether this variant completely evades the protection offered by current vaccines or merely diminishes their effectiveness to some extent. Experts argue that even if the vaccines are less effective against this new variant, they will still likely provide some level of protection and reduce the severity of illness in vaccinated individuals.

Furthermore, many experts emphasize that the emergence of new variants should not deter the ongoing vaccination efforts. The existing vaccines have proven to be highly effective against the original strain of the virus and continue to prevent severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths. Scientists and pharmaceutical companies can also adapt the vaccines to target specific variants relatively quickly, if necessary. This flexibility allows for continuous updates to vaccine formulations that better align with the constantly evolving nature of the virus.

Nevertheless, health officials acknowledge that monitoring and surveillance of emerging variants is crucial to stay ahead of the virus. Identifying new strains early on enables health authorities and researchers to take proactive measures such as adjusting vaccine strategies and implementing additional public health measures to curb the spread of potentially more dangerous variants.

In addition to the B.1.526 variant, several other concerning variants have been identified worldwide. The B.1.1.7 strain, first discovered in the United Kingdom, has shown greater transmissibility than the original virus and has now become the dominant variant in many countries. Similarly, the P.1 variant, originating in Brazil, exhibits characteristics of increased transmissibility and potential evasion of some immunity.

In response to the ongoing threat posed by these variants, health agencies are continuously expanding their genome sequencing efforts to detect and monitor their spread. This surveillance is critical in identifying emerging trends and enabling timely public health interventions.

In conclusion, the discovery of the new B.1.526 variant raises alarm bells about its potential resistance to current COVID-19 vaccines. However, it is vital to understand that this finding is part of an ongoing process of monitoring and adapting to the evolving nature of the virus. Scientists and health officials remain vigilant, assuring the public that vaccinations continue to be a crucial tool in the fight against the pandemic. Staying informed about emerging variants and adhering to recommended safety measures will contribute to minimizing the impact of any potential vaccine-resistant strains in the future.",true
4971,Sanders never considered leaving race after heart attack.,"In an interview with CNN from his Vermont home, where he is recuperating, the senator said he felt “not an ounce of pain” and that, after attending Tuesday’s Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, he’s likely to make trips to Iowa, Nevada and possibly New Hampshire. “We’re ready to go full blast,” Sanders said. His campaign announced that Sanders would use livestream to address and take questions from the United Food and Commercial Workers presidential forum Sunday in Altoona, Iowa. The state kicks off the presidential nominating process in less than four months. “When you hear the word ‘heart attack’, you’re thinking of somebody lying on the ground in terrible pain. It wasn’t the case, OK,” Sanders said. “The day I woke up after the procedure, no pain. Zero pain. No pain right now. I feel really good.” He said he felt symptoms for several weeks that he “should have paid more attention to,” including being especially fatigued after long campaign days, having trouble sleeping and sometimes feeling a “little unsteady” at the podium while speaking at events. He said he once moved to hold a microphone to his mouth and realized his arm hurt. On the evening of Oct. 1, he was at an event in Las Vegas and asked for a chair to be brought on stage “for the first time in my life,” he said. Sweating profusely, he said he left the event quicker than usual and was heading back to the hotel when pain in his arm prompted him to head to an urgent care medical facility where “the doctor made the diagnosis in about three seconds.” Taken by ambulance to the hospital, Sanders said he underwent surgery to insert stents for a blocked artery in about 45 minutes. “Who knows, there’s some folks who think that I might be a little bit stronger because I’ll have an artery that’s not blocked,” Sanders said. He said he’s learned that many hundreds of thousands of people have the same procedure every year. Sanders said he had begun seeing a cardiologist in Vermont who told him he was “on the road to a full recovery.” “There was some damage but, what happens is, is within the next month we’ll see what happens,” he said. “But so far, so very good.” Asked about taking new medications or changes to his diet, Sanders said he would watch his diet more carefully. “We’re going to do better with food.” The interview came hours after Sanders posted a 7-minute online video to supporters saying he’s getting his endurance back and growing “stronger every day.” He also tweeted a clip under the heading “Playoff baseball comes to our backyard” featuring Sanders hitting baseballs and exclaiming “All right!” when a staffer off camera caught one of his popups. While lying in a hospital bed last week in Las Vegas, he said in the video that he “thought about a lot of things, needless to say,” including “what would have happened” if he did not have health insurance through his job as a senator and Medicare. Sanders insisted the experience made him “feel even more strongly” the need to continue “efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system” and provide universal health insurance through a “Medicare for All” plan. He also recalled thinking, “Yeah, I’ve had a rough week. I’ve suffered adversity and that’s true.” But, he added, many people are dealing “with a lot more pain than I am,” including homelessness, the need to work multiple jobs or having to forgo college because of fears about debt. Sanders staff initially said stents were inserted for a blocked artery, revealing only two days later that he had suffered a heart attack. The senator originally suggested he may slow his pace of campaigning after his health scare but backtracked in a Wednesday interview with NBC News. He told CNN that what he meant was that he probably would not do four rallies a day as soon as next week. Sander’s national campaign co-chairwoman, Nina Turner, seemed to back up his original sentiment, though, saying previously that Sanders staffers were examining where and how to make changes to reflect concerns about his health. Asked during the CNN interview about waiting to disclose he had a heart attack, Sanders said “people do have the right to know about the health of a senator and somebody who’s running for president” but that the initial information was incomplete. “The first concern, I think that people had, was we had to understand what was going on,” he said “before we’re going to, you know, reveal information dribble by dribble.”","The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 pandemic to be an ongoing public health emergency. As new variants of the virus continue to emerge, it is imperative for governments around the world to prioritize vaccination efforts and implement stringent preventive measures. The fight against this devastating disease requires a unified global response.

One of the most pressing concerns currently facing health authorities is the appearance of various COVID-19 variants. These mutations possess distinct characteristics that make them more transmissible and potentially more resistant to existing vaccines. Among the prominent variants are the Alpha variant, which was first identified in the United Kingdom, and the Delta variant, initially detected in India.

The highly infectious Delta variant has quickly become the dominant strain in many parts of the world, including the United States. Studies have shown that it is 60 percent more transmissible than the previously dominant Alpha variant. This surge in cases poses a significant threat to unvaccinated populations, especially those living in areas with low vaccination rates.

Amidst these challenges, it is vital for governments to accelerate their vaccination campaigns. Vaccines remain our strongest weapon against the virus. Extensive research has demonstrated their effectiveness in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a concern, fueled by misinformation and skepticism surrounding their safety. Health authorities worldwide must intensify their efforts to educate the public about the benefits and safety of vaccination, dispel myths and conspiracy theories, and address any concerns people may have.

Furthermore, governments need to adapt their policies to the evolving situation. This includes maintaining robust testing and contact tracing systems, enforcing mask mandates, and promoting social distancing measures. Rapid antigen tests can help identify cases promptly, allowing for quick isolation and preventing further transmission. It is crucial for individuals to continue practicing good hand hygiene and following public health guidelines to limit the spread of the virus.

Equitable distribution of vaccines is another critical aspect of this response. Access to vaccines should not be limited to wealthy nations, as this pandemic has underscored the interconnectedness of global health security. Ensuring that low-income countries receive adequate vaccine supplies is imperative in curbing the spread of the virus and preventing the emergence of new variants.

In order to achieve these goals, international cooperation is paramount. Knowledge-sharing among scientists and health authorities is instrumental in monitoring and understanding virus mutations. Furthermore, developed countries with surplus vaccine supplies should share them with those in need, supporting initiatives such as COVAX, which aims to provide equal access to vaccines worldwide.

Finally, it is crucial for individuals to remain vigilant and continue adhering to public health guidelines, even if they are fully vaccinated. Vaccines greatly reduce the risk of severe illness, but breakthrough infections can still occur. Regularly monitoring for symptoms, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and complying with local restrictions will help control the virus's spread while vaccination efforts scale up.

The battle against COVID-19 is far from over. To bring an end to this devastating pandemic, governments worldwide must prioritize vaccination efforts, adapt their strategies to combat evolving variants, ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, and promote international cooperation. By taking these decisive actions collectively, we can work towards a future where public health is safeguarded, and the threat of COVID-19 is no longer a daily concern.",true
7660,"WHO says new China coronavirus could spread, warns hospitals worldwide.","Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. A Chinese woman has been quarantined in Thailand with a mystery strain of coronavirus, Thai authorities said on Monday, the first time the virus has been detected outside China. In all, 41 cases of pneumonia have been reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, which preliminary lab tests cited by state media showed could be from a new type of coronavirus, and one patient has died. There have since been no new cases or deaths, Wuhan health authorities said on Tuesday. “From the information that we have it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit. The WHO is however preparing for the possibility that there could be a wider outbreak, she told a Geneva news briefing. “It is still early days, we don’t have a clear clinical picture.”  Some types of the virus cause less serious diseases, while others - like the one that causes MERS - are far more severe. The U.N. agency has given guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection prevention and control in case the new virus spreads. There is no specific treatment for the new virus, but anti-virals are being considered and could be “re-purposed”, Van Kerkhove said. With Chinese New Year approaching on Jan. 25, when many  Chinese tourists visit Thailand, the WHO called on Thai authorities, the public and holidaymakers to be on alert. Richard Brow, the agency’s representative in Thailand, said anyone with a fever and cough who had spent time in Wuhan should get checked out by a health worker.","'Mask Mandate Boosts Vaccination Rates and Reduces COVID-19 Cases'

As the Delta variant continues to spread, more and more cities and states have been implementing mask mandates. While these mandates have faced their fair share of controversy and resistance, recent data suggests that they are playing a crucial role in boosting vaccination rates and reducing the number of COVID-19 cases.

Numerous studies and real-world examples have shown that masks are highly effective in preventing the transmission of the virus. When combined with other measures such as social distancing and hand hygiene, the use of masks has proven to be instrumental in curbing the spread of COVID-19.

One of the primary arguments against mask mandates has been that they infringe upon personal freedom. However, the evidence overwhelmingly supports their effectiveness, making them an essential tool in the fight against the pandemic.

Several communities that had previously resisted mask mandates have seen a drastic change in their approach due to rising infection rates. Providence, Rhode Island, for instance, recently reinstated its indoor mask mandate after experiencing a surge in cases. The decision was met with strong support from residents who understand the importance of collective action in protecting public health.

Similarly, counties in Arkansas, which had initially banned mask mandates, have started reversing their stance amid a sharp rise in hospitalizations. Local leaders who opposed mask requirements have now recognized that they must take decisive action to save lives and ensure the wellbeing of their communities.

While vaccines are essential in controlling the spread of COVID-19, mask mandates serve as an additional layer of protection, particularly in areas with lower vaccination rates. Studies indicate that wearing masks can reduce the risk of contracting the virus by up to 70%, providing much-needed relief in regions grappling with vaccine hesitancy.

Furthermore, mask mandates have inadvertently played a significant role in encouraging more people to get vaccinated. In communities where masks are mandated, individuals who were previously on the fence about vaccination often reconsider their decision. The realization that mask-wearing may become unnecessary once vaccination rates increase can be a compelling incentive for those who were hesitant to receive the vaccine.

This trend is particularly noticeable among younger demographics. As schools reopen across the country, many districts have implemented mask mandates to ensure the safety of students and staff. In these instances, parents are more likely to get their children vaccinated, recognizing the interdependence of mask use and vaccination in preventing outbreaks within educational settings.

Additionally, businesses and organizations have been working hand in hand with health authorities to enforce mask mandates. From retail stores to concert venues, establishments have adopted stringent policies requiring customers and employees to wear masks. These measures not only protect businesses from potential outbreaks but also convey a sense of responsibility and commitment to public health.

As we continue to navigate the challenges posed by COVID-19, it is crucial that we recognize the value of mask mandates in controlling transmission rates. By embracing them as part of our collective effort, we can protect ourselves and those around us while also moving closer to a society where masks are no longer necessary.",true
8444,Spain's daily coronavirus deaths decline as testing increases.,"Officials hope more testing will give a better indication of the areas where lockdowns can be eased further. “Spain is already one of the countries making the most daily tests. More than 20,000, and we are increasing the number,” Sanchez told a near-empty parliament. Spain’s daily number of deaths from the coronavirus fell to 523 on Wednesday from 567 the day before, the health ministry said - well below a peak of 950 reached on April 2. The International Monetary Fund has said Spain’s economy is likely to suffer heavily from the pandemic, and the government is keen to reactivate whatever businesses it can as soon as possible, especially ahead of the tourist summer months. The IMF expected an 8% economic slump this year, because of the collapse in tourism and Spain’s high proportion of small and medium-sized businesses, with the debt-to-GDP ratio projected to hit 113% - its highest level in over a century. It put the 2020 budget deficit at 9.5% of GDP, the widest in the euro zone. On Monday and Tuesday, sectors including construction and manufacturing were allowed to reopen but, with most people still confined to their homes, shops, bars and public spaces will stay closed until at least April 26. The government said on Wednesday it would begin to hold meetings with opposition leaders from Thursday on the formation of a “pact for the social and economic reconstruction of Spain”. It seeks to unite political parties, unions, companies and regions behind a common economic reconstruction policy and state welfare funding. The proposal is inspired by the 1977 “Pacts of Moncloa” - named for the presidential palace in Madrid - which aimed to transform the state-run economy along market lines for the post-Franco dictatorship democratic era. For the lockdown to be eased more broadly, officials say testing for the virus has to be expanded to include people who have mild or no symptoms, to track the spread in more detail. The government also said last week it would carry out mass antibody tests on the blood of 60,000 randomly chosen people over three weeks, to begin identifying those who might in theory now be immune after exposure to the virus. However, health and virology experts are not yet certain about the quality of such tests, or how much immunity such antibodies might provide. Spain remains one of the world’s worst-affected countries, with only the United States and Italy recording higher cumulative death tolls than the 18,579 reported on Wednesday. The official tally of cases rose by just over 5,000 to 177,633, although Fernando Simon, the national emergency coordinator, said the expansion of testing had meant more mild or asymptomatic cases were being recorded. Despite signs that public health authorities are slowly getting on top of the pandemic, healthcare workers have had no respite. In Barcelona, a doctor filed a complaint with police after her vehicle was scrawled with grafitti reading “contagious rat”, El Periodico newspaper reported. The World Health Organization said on Wednesday that countries should wait at least two weeks before evaluating the impact of loosening their lockdowns and deciding whether to go further. But Spain, having suffered a heavy blow to growth and employment during the euro zone debt crisis, is under acute pressure to restart its economy. The IMF said unemployment, already the highest in the European Union, would jump to nearly 21% from 14% last year. “Those levels of unemployment are not sustainable,” European Central Bank Vice-President Luis de Guindos told Onda Cero radio.","New Variant of COVID-19 Detected in Several Countries Raises Concerns

The emergence of a new variant of the coronavirus has sparked concerns among health officials worldwide. This highly contagious strain, named {summary}, has been identified in multiple countries, leading to increased vigilance and scrutiny in containing its spread.

First detected in {country/region} by local health authorities, this new variant carries mutations in key spike protein sequences, which are responsible for binding to human cells and enabling the virus's entry. Preliminary research suggests that these modifications may make the virus more adept at spreading from person to person compared to previous strains.

While further investigations are underway to understand the full implications of this variant, initial findings have shown a higher rate of transmission. Experts fear that this could result in an exponential surge in cases, potentially overwhelming healthcare systems already grappling with the current pandemic.

Public health agencies across the globe have responded swiftly by implementing intensified surveillance efforts and genetic sequencing programs to identify cases linked to this variant. So far, it has been detected in several countries, including {list of affected countries}. These governments have promptly taken measures to contain the spread, including travel restrictions, enhanced testing protocols, and stricter quarantine guidelines.

Despite these efforts, there is growing concern about the potential impact on vaccine efficacy. The spike protein targeted by current vaccines could be altered enough to diminish the effectiveness of existing inoculations. However, experts remain cautiously optimistic, stating that while changes in the spike protein may reduce vaccine efficacy, the shots should still provide some level of protection against severe illness and hospitalization.

In response to this new threat, several pharmaceutical companies have already initiated investigations into adapting their vaccines to address possible mutations. This includes studying the viability of booster shots or reformulating existing vaccines to cover a broader range of variants. Researchers and manufacturers are closely monitoring the situation and are prepared to adjust vaccine production if necessary.

Public health authorities emphasize the need for continued adherence to preventive measures such as frequent handwashing, mask-wearing, and practicing physical distancing. These actions remain crucial in limiting the transmission of all variants of COVID-19, including the newly identified strain.

The discovery of this variant serves as a reminder that the pandemic is ongoing, and the virus has demonstrated its ability to evolve. While vaccines offer hope for a way out of this global crisis, it is essential not to become complacent and remain vigilant in the face of emerging variants.

In conclusion, the emergence of {summary} has raised concerns among health officials worldwide due to its increased transmissibility. Efforts are underway to contain its spread through travel restrictions and enhanced surveillance. Though concerns about vaccine efficacy persist, experts believe that current shots should still provide some level of protection. Adherence to preventive measures remains critical in combating the new variant and controlling the ongoing pandemic.",true
4682,Officials warn after worker with hepatitis A handled food.,"The Lawrence County Health Department said Tuesday the infected Burger King employee worked from May 15-19, and from May 22-24. Patrons who consumed food or drink at the eatery between May 22-24 were urged to get vaccinated by Thursday. Anyone who ate there during the two periods when that employee was working is advised to monitor their health for symptoms up to 50 days and to wash their hands thoroughly. Hepatitis A is a viral disease that can spread through close contact with an infected person. Symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dark urine.","COVID-19 Boosts Demand for Mental Health Services

The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on people's mental health, resulting in an increased demand for mental health services worldwide. This surge in demand is driven by various factors, including the stress and anxiety caused by the pandemic itself, as well as the indirect consequences such as social isolation, economic instability, and the loss of loved ones.

One of the primary reasons behind the increased demand for mental health services is the psychological impact of living through a pandemic. The fear of contracting the virus, experiencing severe illness, or losing a loved one has contributed to widespread anxiety among individuals. Moreover, the constant bombardment of news related to the pandemic, its rising death toll, and the uncertainty surrounding its containment efforts have only heightened people's stress levels.

Another significant factor exacerbating mental health issues during these challenging times is the social isolation imposed by quarantine measures. Many countries implemented strict lockdowns, restricting people from physically interacting with friends, family, and support networks. This isolation has left many individuals feeling lonely, depressed, and disconnected from their normal routines.

Additionally, COVID-19 has triggered a global economic crisis that has led to widespread job losses, financial instability, and the inability to meet basic needs. These financial strains have further strained people's mental well-being, pushing them towards seeking professional mental health support. The strain is particularly visible among marginalized communities who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic's economic consequences.

The prolonged duration of the pandemic and the resulting changes in daily routines have also disrupted crucial coping mechanisms for many individuals. Pre-pandemic activities such as exercise, hobbies, and maintaining social connections have been severely limited, making it harder for people to manage stress and maintain good mental health.

Recognizing the increased need for mental health services, governments, healthcare institutions, and nonprofits have stepped up efforts to expand access to care. Many mental health helplines, counseling centers, and online therapy services have been established to support individuals in need. Teletherapy, in particular, has become increasingly popular as it provides convenient and accessible mental health support while adhering to physical distancing guidelines.

In some countries, governments have allocated additional funds for mental health services, recognizing the dire need during these challenging times. This increased investment is intended to enhance infrastructure, train more mental health professionals, and improve the quality of care provided. Furthermore, mental health awareness campaigns have been launched to reduce stigmatization and encourage individuals to seek help when needed.

However, despite these efforts to expand mental health services, many challenges remain. Limited resources, long waiting lists, and difficulties accessing care still persist in many regions. Marginalized communities may face even greater barriers due to disparities in healthcare access and affordability. Addressing these systemic issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes increased funding, targeted interventions, and the integration of mental health services into primary healthcare systems.

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the global demand for mental health services. The psychological impact of living through a pandemic, social isolation, economic instability, and disrupted coping mechanisms have all contributed to the increasing prevalence of mental health problems. While efforts have been made to expand mental health services, further investments are needed to ensure access to care for all individuals. As the world continues to grapple with this ongoing crisis, prioritizing mental health support is crucial to mitigate the long-term consequences on individuals, families, and communities.",true
3556,US preschoolers less pudgy in latest sign of falling obesity.,"Obesity rates dropped steadily to about 14% in 2016 — the latest data available — from 16% in 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. “It gives us more hope that this is a real change,” said Heidi Blanck, who heads obesity prevention at the CDC. The results were published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The improvement affected youngsters ages 2 through 4 who receive food vouchers and other services in the federal Women, Infants and Children nutrition program. About 1 in 5 U.S. kids that age were enrolled in 2016. An earlier report involving program participants the same age found at least small declines in obesity in 18 states between 2008 and 2011. That was the first decline after years of increases that later plateaued, and researchers weren’t sure if it was just a blip. Improvements in food options in that program including adding more fruits, vegetables and whole grains may have contributed to the back-to-back obesity declines, researchers said. Other data show obesity rates in 2016 were stable but similar, about 14 percent, for children aged 2 to 5 who were not enrolled in the program, Blanck noted. While too many U.S. children are still too heavy, the findings should be celebrated, said Dr. William Dietz, a former CDC obesity expert. “The changes are meaningful and substantial.” Dietz said program changes that cut the amount of juice allowed and switched from high-fat to low-fat milk likely had the biggest impact. He estimated that amounted to an average of 9,000 fewer monthly calories per child. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends low-fat milk for children. It also suggests kids should limit juice intake and choose fresh fruits instead. Further reducing U.S. childhood obesity will require broader changes — such as encouraging families and day care centers to routinely serve fruits, vegetables and whole grains; and employers to extend parental leave to make breastfeeding easier for new mothers, said Maureen Black, a child development and nutrition specialist at the University of Maryland. Studies have shown breastfed infants are less likely than others to become obese later on. ___ Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner: @LindseyTanner ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

The world continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as a new variant, named Omicron, has emerged, sparking concerns among health officials worldwide. This highly transmissible strain was initially identified in South Africa and has quickly drawn attention due to its numerous mutations and potential resistance to existing vaccines.

Scientists are closely monitoring the Omicron variant and studying its characteristics to determine the level of threat it poses to public health. Early findings suggest a significantly higher number of mutations in the spike protein that the virus uses to enter human cells compared to previous variants. This has led experts to worry about how well existing COVID-19 vaccines will work against this new strain.

Health officials stress the urgent need for more research to ascertain the severity of illness caused by Omicron and its resistance to current preventive measures. Preliminary data from South Africa indicates that while infections are increasing rapidly, hospitalization rates remain low so far. However, experts caution that it is still too early to draw conclusive evidence about the severity of the disease caused by the variant.

Responding to the emergence of the Omicron variant, governments around the globe have swiftly implemented precautionary measures to curb its spread. Several countries, including the United States, Canada, and European nations, have imposed travel restrictions on affected regions and mandated stringent testing measures for incoming travelers.

Moreover, some countries are reinstating previously lifted restrictions and reintroducing mask mandates, social distancing guidelines, and capacity limits to prevent potential outbreaks. These proactive steps aim to slow down transmission rates, gain time for scientists to gather more information, and evaluate the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the new variant.

While vaccines developed against earlier variants, such as Delta and Alpha, may have reduced efficacy against Omicron, health authorities are urging individuals to remain calm, follow recommended precautions, and promptly get vaccinated. Boosters shots are also being recommended for those eligible, as they could potentially increase protection against the new variant.

Pharmaceutical companies are already working on adjusting vaccines and developing new ones specifically targeting the Omicron variant. However, producing and distributing these modified vaccines will take time, leaving the global population vulnerable in the interim.

The emergence of the Omicron variant underscores the importance of continued surveillance, rapid genomic sequencing, and international collaboration in combating COVID-19. Scientists argue that investment in public health infrastructure and vaccine equity across countries is crucial to prevent future variants and control the spread of the virus globally.

As governments and health agencies closely monitor the evolving situation, it is critical for citizens to stay informed through credible sources and adhere to public health guidelines. Maintaining personal hygiene practices, practicing social distancing, wearing masks in crowded places, and avoiding large gatherings can help limit the transmission of not only the new variant but all strains of COVID-19.

Nevertheless, the arrival of the Omicron variant reinforces the unpredictable nature of the pandemic. It serves as a reminder that the fight against COVID-19 is far from over, and collective efforts are necessary to protect vulnerable populations, minimize disruptions to daily life, and bring an end to this global health crisis.",true
2605,Philippines defies church to push family planning.,"The predominately Catholic country has one of Asia’s fastest-growing populations together with significant levels of chronic poverty. While neighbours have accelerated towards prosperity, the Philippines has lagged. Economists say high population growth is a primary factor for that, but the church disagrees. It says population growth is not a cause of poverty and that people need jobs, not contraception. Aquino, a Catholic like 80 percent of the population, has thrown his support behind a reproductive health bill that will, if passed by the two houses of Congress, guarantee access to free birth control and promote sex education. That’s something that Liza Cabiya-an might have benefited from, if she’d had the opportunity. Cabiya-an, 39, has 14 children. The oldest is 22, the youngest just 11 months. Their home is a hut in a Manila slum. “It’s tough when you have so many children,” said Cabiya-an, a shy smile revealing poor teeth. “I have to count them before I go to sleep to make sure no one’s missing.”  At one time Cabiya-an had access to contraception but Manila mayor Jose Atienza, a devout Catholic, swept contraceptives from the shelves of city-run clinics in 2000. After that, Cabiya-an’s efforts to limit the size of her family were patchy, restricted by her meager resources. She went on and off the pill and resorted to an illegal abortion more than once. With income of about 7,600 pesos ($180) a month from doing laundry and her husband’s pay as a labourer, Cabiya-an has only been able to send five of her children to school. The others would appear doomed to join the quarter of the country’s 95 million people stuck below the poverty line. Contraceptives are generally available in the Philippines although they are not used as much as elsewhere. In the Philippines, 45-50 percent of women of reproductive age, or their partners, are using a contraceptive method at any given time. Indonesia’s rate is 56 percent and Thailand’s 80 percent. Population growth mirrors that. The Philippines population is increasing by 1.9 percent a year, while Indonesia’s is 1.2 percent and Thailand’s is 0.9 percent. China’s population is growing at an annual rate of 0.6 percent. “If you increase access to contraceptives for women ... you will have births averted,” said Josefina Natividad, director of the University of the Philippines’ Population Institute. Though available in most places, the cost of contraceptives is prohibitive for many people. But that should change if the reproductive health bill is passed. Aquino’s government has promised what it calls inclusive growth and it sees slowing population growth as key to that. “The president has already, at the risk of alienating the church, declared that the bill is a priority,” Budget Secretary Florencio Abad said. “That message is very clear.”  But it’s a message the church doesn’t like. It says artificial contraception is immoral, and the bill will pave the way to legalizing abortion. The bill does not legalize abortion though it seeks to improve care for women suffering from complications after an illegal abortion. The church says people should use natural family planning. It says poverty is a cause, not effect, of a high birth rate. Children are being born into homes without enough food to eat because of the government’s failure to end corruption and provide jobs, the bishops say. “It’s our firm belief that contraceptives will never be the answer,” said Father Melvin Castro, executive secretary of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines’ Episcopal Commission on Family and Life. “They are poor not because they have no access to contraceptives but because they have no work. Give them work and it will be the most effective birth spacing means for them.”  Economists say the church’s persistent opposition has been the most important factor influencing population policy. “The state ... has been immobilized from effectively addressing the issue by the Catholic hierarchy’s hardline position,” a group of 30 economists from the University of the Philippines said in a recent paper. But despite the arguments of the church and political opponents who decry using state funds to finance contraception, a poll last year showed about 70 percent of people support the bill. Its backers want it passed during the term of this congress, which ends in June. Economists say if the Philippines is ever to take advantage of a “demographic dividend”, when a large, young workforce is generating the savings and investment to give the economy a sustained boost, it will have to bring down the fertility rate. The median age in the Philippines is only 22.2 compared with 25 in Malaysia, India’s 25.1 and Indonesia’s 27.8. Unlike aging countries such as Japan, where the elderly put a burden on the working population, in the Philippines it’s the children who command the resources that could otherwise be diverted to savings and investment. There are 58 dependents for every 100 working-age people in the Philippines, according to World Bank data, compared with 40 in Indonesia and 29 in Thailand. “The demographic window will only open if fertility rates are going to go down in such a way that the young-age population will grow at a slower rate than the working-age population,” said Arsenio Balisacan, socio-economic planning secretary. Aquino might seem an unlikely champion of free contraception. His late mother, Corazon Aquino, rose to power at the head of a people power revolution, fostered by the church, that swept away old dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. Marcos had made reining in population growth a priority beginning in the 1960s and enshrined family planning in a 1973 constitution. But Corazon Aquino, mindful of the church’s help in the democracy movement, scrapped that clause when the charter was rewritten in 1987.

The worrisome rise in COVID-19 cases across the globe has become more alarming due to the emergence of new variants. Experts are increasingly concerned about the rapid spread of these variants and their potential impact on public health. 

One such variant, the Delta variant, first identified in India, is now causing significant challenges in several countries. This highly contagious variant has been documented in numerous countries, including the United Kingdom, where it has become the dominant strain. Scientists believe that the Delta variant is spreading 40% to 60% faster than the previously dominant Alpha variant. In addition to its increased transmissibility, preliminary studies suggest that this variant may also be associated with a higher risk of hospitalization.

The Delta plus variant, which is a mutation of the Delta variant, has also recently caught the attention of researchers. Although still being studied, early evidence suggests that this variant may be even more transmissible. Its potential resistance to certain treatments and vaccines further highlight the urgency of understanding and monitoring this variant closely.

While the Delta variants grab headlines, other concerning variants of interest continue to emerge worldwide. The Lambda variant, initially identified in Peru, has been characterized by the World Health Organization as a ""variant of interest."" Though not yet as widespread as the Delta variant, recent reports from South America have indicated increasing cases linked to this variant. Researchers are actively investigating the Lambda variant's transmissibility and vaccine resistance to inform public health strategies.

These emerging variants raise concerns about the efficacy of current vaccines and the importance of maintaining public health measures. However, experts emphasize that vaccination remains a critical tool in controlling the spread of COVID-19, including its variants. Studies indicate that while some variants, like the Delta variant, may lead to breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals, the vaccines still offer significant protection against severe illness and hospitalization. Therefore, increasing vaccination rates and ensuring widespread access to vaccines remain paramount in combating the Delta variant and other emerging variants.

In response to the evolving situation, several countries have adjusted their public health measures. The United Kingdom recently delayed its reopening plans due to the surge in Delta variant cases. Japan has banned foreign spectators from attending the Olympic Games amidst concerns about the spread of variants. These responsive actions demonstrate an acknowledgment of the potential risks posed by variants and a commitment to protecting public health.

Experts underscore the need for continued surveillance and sequencing efforts to identify new variants as early as possible. This information can guide targeted public health interventions and inform vaccine development strategies. In addition, global collaboration and equitable access to vaccines must be prioritized to control the spread of COVID-19 variants on a global scale.

The emergence of new variants serves as a stark reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. As countries work towards achieving widespread vaccination coverage, individuals must remain vigilant, follow public health guidelines, and adapt to changing circumstances. By doing so, it is possible to mitigate the impact of these variants and move closer to a post-pandemic world.",true
8764,"Cancer, diabetes leave fingerprints in blood, serum.","In an article published in the latest issue of Cell  Research, the Chinese researchers described how they found such  altered molecular biomarkers, called microRNAs, to be stable in  the serum and blood of people who were ill.    “This is a revolutionary finding, this is the first time we  have been able to demonstrate that microRNA is stable in  serum,” Zhang Chen-yu at the Jiangsu Diabetes Centre in China’s  eastern province of Jiangsu told Reuters by telephone. The scientists analyzed the blood of both healthy people  and patients with lung cancer, colorectal cancer and diabetes,  and found that those who were ill had altered biomarkers that  were vastly different from the healthy participants. Zhang said patients of one disease would have biomarkers  that were markedly different from patients of another disease  — and in theory, doctors can tell what disease is afflicting a  person by just analyzing the blood. “We found different (classes of) biomarkers for lung  cancer, colorectal cancer and diabetes, these biomarkers can  reflect almost all pathological conditions,” Zhang said. This means diagnosis can be made without current invasive  methods, which include removing tissue samples. Looking ahead, Zhang said the team hoped to push for such  biomarker screenings to be done in local clinics to alleviate  the pressure on overcrowded government hospitals.","New COVID-19 Variant Detected in Multiple Countries Raises Concerns

A new variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been identified in several countries, sparking concerns among health officials worldwide. This recently discovered mutation, called B.1.617, has been found predominantly in India but has since been reported in various parts of the world.

Initial studies suggest that the B.1.617 variant may be more transmissible than previous strains of the virus. Researchers have observed an increase in cases where this variant is present, leading them to believe it could contribute to the recent surge in infections seen in some areas.

While experts are scrambling to gather comprehensive data on this particular variant, the prevailing evidence so far indicates that the B.1.617 mutation carries two key mutations in the spike protein of the virus. These changes, known as E484Q and L452R, may affect the virus's ability to invade human cells, potentially making it more contagious.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the B.1.617 variant as a variant of interest (VOI), indicating that it warrants close monitoring due to its potential public health risks. However, it is essential to note that it has not yet been classified as a variant of concern (VOC), which would require strong evidence to demonstrate its increased severity or ability to evade current treatments and vaccines.

Several countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Germany, and Singapore, have now reported cases linked to the B.1.617 variant. Authorities in these nations are implementing strict measures to contain its spread and prevent potential community transmission. Travel restrictions, enhanced testing protocols, and contact tracing efforts have been intensified to limit the variant's impact.

Scientists and vaccine manufacturers are also closely examining the efficacy of existing vaccines against this latest mutation. Preliminary lab studies using blood samples from vaccinated individuals indicate that antibodies generated by COVID-19 vaccines may still provide protection against the B.1.617 variant. However, further research is underway to evaluate the vaccine's effectiveness in real-world scenarios, particularly concerning this particular mutation.

With the global vaccination campaign gaining momentum, health authorities are urging citizens not to panic but to remain vigilant. The emergence of new variants reinforces the importance of adhering to public health guidelines such as wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene, maintaining physical distancing, and getting vaccinated.

Global collaboration and information sharing among scientists and public health agencies are critical in understanding the characteristics and potential impact of the B.1.617 variant. By closely monitoring its spread and studying its mutations, experts hope to stay ahead of the virus's evolution and make informed decisions regarding policy responses and vaccine development strategies.

In times like these, it becomes even more evident that a robust surveillance system combined with timely and accurate data is essential in controlling the pandemic's course. Governments, health organizations, and citizens must work together to implement necessary measures effectively, mitigate the emergence of new variants, and protect vulnerable populations, ultimately bringing an end to the COVID-19 crisis.",true
1395,"Study finds UK sugar tax could save thousands from obesity, diabetes.","In a study on the levy’s health impacts, researchers found the positive effect would be greatest if the drinks industry responds by reformulating products to cut sugar content, rather than keep the same formulations but raise prices to consumers. The planned levy is tiered, starting from no tax on diet and low sugar drinks, a low tax on mid-sugar drinks containing 5 to 8 grams (g) of sugar per 100 millilitres (ml), and a high tax on very sugary drinks containing 8g or more per 100 ml. The government’s health department says sugary drinks are the single biggest source of sugar for children, who can have more than their recommended daily intake just by drinking a can of cola, which has nine teaspoons of sugar. The scientists studied three possible reactions by companies to the levy. They could reformulate drinks to reduce sugar content, pass some of the levy to consumers by raising the price of sugary drinks, or use marketing to encourage consumers to switch to lower sugar drinks. The Lancet Public Health journal published the results. For each scenario, the researchers mapped a realistic better and worse case scenario for health by estimating the likely impact on rates of obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. “The good news is that our study suggests that all of the most likely industry responses ... have the potential to improve health,” said Adam Briggs of Oxford University, who led the study. “The extent of the health benefits of the tax will depend on industry’s response.”  In opting for a sugar tax, Britain joins Belgium, France, Hungary and Mexico, all of which have imposed some form of tax on drinks with added sugar. Scandinavian countries have levied similar taxes for many years. According to the study’s modeling, a 30 percent reduction in sugar content of all high-sugar drinks and a 15 percent reduction in mid-sugar drinks could result in 14,400 fewer adults and children with obesity, 19,000 fewer cases of type 2 diabetes a year, and 26,900 fewer decaying teeth annually. Passing on half of the cost of the levy to consumers with a price rise for high and mid-sugar drinks of up to 20 percent could reduce the number of adults and children with obesity by 81,600, result in 10,800 fewer diabetes cases and 14,900 fewer decaying teeth a year. Speaking to reporters at a briefing in London, Briggs and his team said the most likely real-life response from industry would probably involve a combination of the scenarios in the study, which might mean the benefits could increase. “The direction of the effect is clear,” said Susan Jebb, an Oxford professor who co-led the research. “This levy will have a positive impact, especially on children’s health.”","Vaccination Rates Soar as Confidence Grows in COVID-19 Vaccines

In a major win for public health, vaccination rates against COVID-19 have been skyrocketing as confidence in the vaccines continues to grow. Despite initial skepticism and concerns, people are now lining up in record numbers to get their shots as they see friends, family, and colleagues receive the vaccine with no ill effects.

As more individuals receive their inoculations, herd immunity comes closer to reality. Health experts stress that achieving herd immunity is crucial in containing the virus's spread and returning society to pre-pandemic normalcy.

One reason for the surge in vaccination rates is the scientific evidence demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. Numerous studies have shown that the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines significantly reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death.

Public health agencies and governments worldwide have also played a vital role in building trust and spreading accurate information about the vaccines. By conducting thorough research and providing transparent data, they have countered misinformation and addressed concerns.

Efforts to improve access and convenience have further contributed to the rapid rise in vaccination rates. Governments at all levels have established mass vaccination sites, often in stadiums, convention centers, or drive-through facilities, providing easy access for communities. Additionally, pop-up clinics and mobile vaccination units have been deployed in underserved areas, ensuring equitable distribution of vaccines.

Community leaders, including politicians, celebrities, and religious figures, have used their influence to encourage others to get vaccinated. Through public service announcements, social media campaigns, and personal examples, they have helped promote vaccine confidence and dispel any doubts about its efficacy.

Moreover, incentives offered by some cities and businesses have proven successful in incentivizing individuals to get vaccinated. Freebies such as gift cards, discounts, and even cash prizes have enticed those hesitant to roll up their sleeves. In some cases, workplaces have offered paid time off for employees to receive their shots, further removing barriers to vaccination.

As a result of these robust efforts, the vaccination rate has soared across the globe. In countries where vaccines are readily available, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, millions are getting vaccinated daily. Furthermore, low-income countries are now receiving additional support through various initiatives, including vaccine donations from wealthier nations, to ensure equitable access worldwide.

The positive impact of increasing vaccination rates is already becoming evident. In many areas with high vaccination coverage, local transmission rates have significantly dropped, leading to eased restrictions and a sense of normalcy returning. Businesses are reopening, events are taking place, and people can once again gather safely with friends and loved ones.

Despite this remarkable progress, health authorities continue to stress the importance of remaining vigilant. Variants of concern, such as the Delta variant, remind us that the virus is still capable of causing outbreaks if given the opportunity. Continued adherence to preventive measures, such as mask-wearing, hand hygiene, and social distancing, is crucial until herd immunity is achieved worldwide.

Public health experts remain cautiously optimistic about the future. With vaccination rates soaring and confidence in the vaccines growing, there is hope that society can finally put the worst of the pandemic behind them. By embracing the power of vaccinations and continuing to follow recommended guidelines, we inch closer to a world free from the fear and devastation of COVID-19.

10518,Aggressive Treatment May Be Beneficial for Early Prostate Cancer,"There was no discussion of costs. Costs would include treating the double digit rates of incontinence and erectile dysfunction in these younger men who do have surgery. The surgery may help them live longer, but many, especially since younger at time of surgery, live decades with these potential harms and folllowup costs of the surgical choice. This should get at least a line in such stories. While describing some of the differences observed in general terms without quantification, the story provided absolute percentage of men dying from prostate cancer in the two study groups. The story then went on to explain that the difference was in the men who were less 65 years of age at the time of diagnosis. The story would have been better if it had more clearly explained this important caveat about the benefit seen. The potential harms associated with various approaches to treating prostate cancer as well as the increased risk of prostate cancer progression and death seen in the cohort of men who followed the watchful waiting approach were discussed. The story did a laudable job of providing information about the study reported on including the fact that the results most recently published basically expand the timeframe of followup on these men which have previously been published. It provided insight about the number of men involved in the study, how their prostate cancer was detected and that the men had been randomly assigned to their treatment group. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. Two clinicians who were not involved in the study provided quotes which were used in the story. The story included a list of the commonly available treatment options for early stage prostate cancer. But we must give an unsatisfactory score because the story included a factually incorrect statement indicating that watchful waiting is synonymous with active surveillance. It is not. The story went on to misinform readers by indicating “watchful waiting is often recommended when a man is not expected to die of the cancer” by failing to complete the thought by explaining that the reason they are not expected to die of the cancer is because their advanced age makes it unlikely that the cancer will have sufficient time to progress to lethality OR because they have other diseases from which they are likely to succumb before there is time for the prostate cancer to be deadly. An important caveat about how the prostate cancer in the study differed from the way in which prostate cancer is most commonly detected today in the US was explained. The story provided a reasonable view of the novelty of the treatment options detailed in the study along with the critically important caveat that the majority of the men in the study had their prostate cancer first detected at a later state than is seen with the current screening practices in the US. The story did not rely on a news release.","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought forth numerous challenges and disruptions to the global healthcare system. As countries scramble to contain the virus and develop effective mitigation strategies, an essential aspect that demands attention is mental health.

One cannot underestimate the toll that the pandemic has taken on people's mental health. The fear surrounding the virus, coupled with social isolation and economic distress, has led to a significant increase in stress, anxiety, and depression worldwide. Many individuals are grappling with the loss of loved ones, unemployment, and financial instability, exacerbating their emotional turmoil.

Studies have shown that there is a surge in reported cases of mental health conditions since the onset of the pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts a prolonged and profound impact on global mental health, akin to a ""second pandemic."" With the virus still spreading and uncertain future prospects, the psychological repercussions are far-reaching and persistent.

Healthcare systems worldwide were already struggling with limited mental health resources before the pandemic hit. However, the current crisis has stretched these services thin, making it even more challenging for individuals to access vital support. Long wait times for therapy, reduced availability of psychiatrists, and overwhelmed helplines leave many feeling abandoned and helpless.

The consequences of neglecting mental health can be grave. Research suggests that untreated mental health conditions can lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates. Pre-existing mental health conditions may worsen, while new cases emerge due to the stressful circumstances induced by the pandemic. Additionally, the impact on frontline healthcare workers ?C who have been tirelessly battling the virus ?C cannot be underestimated. Their mental well-being is crucial to sustaining the fight against COVID-19.

Recognizing the urgency of the situation, governments and organizations are taking steps to address mental health concerns. Teletherapy and remote counseling services have been implemented to ensure continued access to care. Helplines and crisis centers have extended their working hours and capacity. Additionally, mental health experts are advocating for the inclusion of mental healthcare in universal health coverage policies, urging decision-makers to prioritize this critical aspect of public health.

However, there is still much work to be done. Increased funding is required to enhance mental health infrastructure, recruit more mental health professionals, and expand community-based services. Public campaigns focusing on destigmatizing mental illness, promoting psychological resilience, and encouraging help-seeking should also be prioritized.

Furthermore, collaboration between healthcare systems, policymakers, and mental health organizations needs to be strengthened to effectively respond to the growing mental health crisis. Sharing best practices, developing evidence-based interventions, and facilitating knowledge transfer will contribute to a more comprehensive response.

As countries continue the battle against COVID-19 and work towards recovery, mental health cannot be left behind. Just as physical well-being is crucial, so too is mental well-being. Supporting mental health not only helps individuals cope with the challenges of the pandemic but also ensures a healthier and more resilient society. By acknowledging the impact of the pandemic on mental health and investing in robust support systems, we can pave the way for a brighter and healthier future.",true
4775,Republicans lack votes _ and appetite _ to end ‘Obamacare’.,"It could well be too little, too late. After years of trying to demolish former President Barack Obama’s prized law, GOP leaders still lack the votes to succeed. Along with the law’s growing popularity and easing premium increases, that’s left top Republicans showing no appetite to quickly refight the repeal battle. “I’m not going to be asking for another vote on that this year,” No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Cornyn of Texas said last week when asked if he favored reopening the issue in a postelection lame duck session. No. 3 House leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said, “We need to win this election and then get more seats next year.” Each is their party’s chief vote counter. That means any serious push to annul the statute would almost certainly hinge on Republicans retaining House control and adding Senate seats in November’s elections, neither of which is assured. If either goal eludes them on Election Day, President Donald Trump’s ability to deliver on one of his top campaign promises would have to wait for a second term, if he gets one. Republicans seemed to gain ground last week when Sen. Jon Kyl replaced McCain, who died in August from brain cancer. Kyl said in a brief interview that he would have backed the measure that McCain opposed, a pivotal vote that would have sustained the repeal drive. “It seems to me that would have been a useful thing to do,” Kyl said. That bill failed 51-49. A “yes” from McCain would have meant a 50-50 tie that Vice President Mike Pence could have broken by casting his own vote. Yet the two other GOP senators who also voted no, Maine’s Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, haven’t relented. With Republicans controlling the Senate 51-49, the GOP remains short of the 50 votes they’d need. “I would still oppose outright repeal,” Collins said in a short interview last week. In a written statement, aides said Murkowski “is not interested in another rushed, partisan process in the absence of a quality, comprehensive replacement” for the law. Republicans have one fewer seat this year because Alabama Democrat Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore in a December special election. Moore had defeated incumbent GOP Sen. Luther Strange in a party primary. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has ruled out revisiting the health care fight before November’s midterm elections, citing the crush of spending and other bills facing Congress. He’s displayed little desire to revisit the issue, which many Democrats are using in their election campaigns because Obama’s law is widely accepted, especially provisions like requiring insurers to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions. Returning to the health care fight is a decision “I don’t have to reach anytime soon and don’t have time to facilitate, even if I was so inclined,” McConnell told reporters last week. He has said he doesn’t want to resume the fight unless he can win, and his House counterpart is also showing his focus is elsewhere. “I haven’t even thought about it,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. A lame-duck session would last barely over a month and likely be absorbed with lingering budget disputes and picking the new Congress’ leaders. That would leave scant time for health care work, such as resolving intractable disputes about what a replacement bill would look like. Then they would need an official cost estimate of any bill from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which could take weeks. They’d also have to take procedural steps to protect their bill from a Senate Democratic filibuster, which would otherwise essentially kill the measure by requiring Republicans to garner 60 votes to succeed. “There’s still a process that we have to go through, and people have to be aware of it,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who opposes the health care program. “You don’t just drop it from heaven like manna.” Explaining the diminished urgency, Cornyn cited Congress’ repeal last December of the tax penalty on people who don’t buy individual insurance. That requirement, aimed at prodding healthier people to buy coverage and stabilize health markets, was one of the law’s least popular provisions. Cornyn also mentioned Trump administration rules making it easier for people to buy short-term health care policies or association plans offered by groups of small businesses or self-employed people. Such packages could offer lower premiums but cover fewer benefits, and Democrats criticize them as undermining the consumer protections Obama’s law was designed to enshrine. Also easing pressure on Republicans to act are indications that insurance premiums, a major vexation for voters, are growing more slowly. An analysis by the consulting firm Avalere Health and The Associated Press last week found a 3.3 percent average increase in proposed or approved premiums across 47 states and Washington, D.C., for 2019. The average increase nationally this year was about 30 percent. Meanwhile, the House plans to vote this week on a bill easing requirements the law imposed on employers. The measure would make it easier for companies to provide health insurance for fewer workers, refund tax penalties firms paid for not covering employees and postpone a levy on expensive policies companies provide workers. Further underscoring the effort’s lack of traction, that measure seems certain never to emerge from Congress.","COVID-19 Variants: The Ongoing Battle to Control the Virus

As the world continues its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, a new threat has emerged in the form of rapidly spreading variants of the virus. These variants, with their increased transmissibility and potential resistance to existing vaccines, have posed fresh challenges for public health officials worldwide.

One of the most concerning variants is the Delta variant, which was first identified in India and has now spread to numerous countries. Health experts warn that this highly contagious variant is responsible for surging case numbers in communities where it has become dominant. In response, countries have implemented various measures, such as travel restrictions and enhanced testing, to control its spread.

The Delta variant's ability to reinfect even those who have received both doses of a vaccine has raised concerns about the effectiveness of existing immunization efforts. Studies suggest that while vaccines still provide significant protection against severe illness and hospitalization, breakthrough infections can occur. This information has led authorities to emphasize the importance of receiving booster shots to enhance immunity.

Furthermore, another variant called the Lambda variant, originally identified in Peru, has also captured the attention of global health organizations. While not as widespread as the Delta variant, Lambda is known for its high mutation rate, which could potentially enable it to evade immune responses. Researchers are closely studying this variant to determine its implications for vaccine efficacy and transmissibility.

With the emergence of these variants, the importance of continued adherence to public health measures cannot be overstated. Wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and maintaining hand hygiene remain crucial in limiting the spread of all versions of the virus. Experts also stress the need for widespread vaccination to achieve herd immunity and reduce the likelihood of new variants arising through viral replication in unvaccinated populations.

In response to the evolving threat, numerous countries have updated their vaccination strategies. Some have opened up eligibility criteria to lower age groups, while others are prioritizing areas with high variant prevalence for vaccine distribution. The goal is to limit opportunities for new variants to develop and spread while providing protection to the most vulnerable populations.

Research and development efforts are also underway to enhance vaccine effectiveness against these variants. Pharmaceutical companies are actively exploring modified versions of existing vaccines or booster shots specifically targeting the Delta variant to improve immunity. Scientists are optimistic that such adaptations will provide broader protection against multiple variants of concern.

In recent weeks, breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated individuals have sparked debates surrounding the need for additional preventive measures. Some argue for the reintroduction of mask mandates in indoor public spaces, regardless of vaccination status. Proponents believe that this measure could prevent further transmission and mitigate the impact of breakthrough infections.

Despite these challenges, public health officials maintain that vaccines are an essential tool in combating COVID-19 and its variants. Vaccination rates have played a crucial role in curbing severe illness and reducing hospitalizations even in the face of new variants. As more scientific knowledge is gathered, adjustments in vaccine strategies and public health guidelines will continue to be made to address emerging threats effectively.

The battle against COVID-19 is far from over, but with ongoing research, adapted vaccines, and collective commitment to public health measures, it is hoped that the world can overcome the challenge posed by these variants. In the meantime, communities must remain vigilant, informed, and willing to adapt to ensure the continued fight against the virus and protect the health and well-being of global populations.",true
8340,India will allow some exports of anti-malaria drug after Trump appeal.,"The Indian government had earlier put a hold on exports of hydroxychloroquine as well as on the pain reliever, paracetamol, saying it had to meet its internal demand. But Trump spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the weekend seeking supplies and later hinted that India may face retaliation. “It has been decided that India would licence paracetamol and HCQ in appropriate quantities to all our neighbouring countries who are dependent on our capabilities,” said Indian foreign ministry spokesman, Anurag Srivastava. “We will also be supplying these essential drugs to some nations who have been particularly badly affected by the pandemic,” he said.","COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Stumbles as Challenges Mount

As the world eagerly awaited the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, hopes were high that widespread vaccination efforts would soon bring an end to the devastating pandemic. However, the initial excitement has given way to frustration and disappointment, as the distribution of vaccines faces numerous challenges.

One of the major hurdles faced by countries around the globe is the limited supply of available vaccines. With the demand far exceeding the available doses, governments are finding it difficult to meet the expectations of their citizens. Pharmaceutical companies are working tirelessly to increase production, but ramping up manufacturing to reach billions of people worldwide is no small feat.

In addition to the supply shortage, logistical issues have posed unforeseen problems. The stringent temperature requirements for storing and transporting certain vaccines, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, have made distribution even more complex. The need for ultra-cold storage facilities and specialized transportation has slowed down the process and created bottlenecks in getting the vaccines to the intended recipients.

Moreover, distributing the vaccines in an equitable manner has proved to be a challenge. Many countries are struggling with the question of who should receive the limited doses first. Ethical considerations, along with public health factors, have led to different prioritization strategies across nations. While frontline healthcare workers and vulnerable populations are often top priorities, the specific order in which different groups receive the vaccine varies from country to country, leading to confusion and criticism.

Communication has also played a crucial role in the success or failure of vaccine distribution efforts. Clear and accurate information about safety, efficacy, and availability is essential to gaining public trust in the vaccination process. However, misinformation and conspiracy theories continue to circulate, undermining efforts to educate the public and combat vaccine hesitancy. Governments and health organizations must prioritize effective communication strategies to ensure that all citizens have access to reliable information and understand the importance of getting vaccinated.

Another significant challenge emerging in the distribution process is the development of new variants of the virus. As new strains spread across different regions, concerns arise about the effectiveness of available vaccines against these variants. Scientists are working diligently to assess the situation and adapt vaccines if necessary. However, this ongoing research adds another layer of complexity to the distribution efforts and further emphasizes the need for a rapid and efficient vaccination campaign.

Despite all these challenges, there have been notable successes in some countries. Israel, for instance, has managed to vaccinate a significant proportion of its population in a short period. Their success can be attributed to a well-organized vaccination program and effective deployment of resources. Other countries can learn valuable lessons from these success stories to improve their own vaccination strategies.

As governments and health agencies continue to confront these obstacles, it is crucial to remember that vaccination efforts are a marathon rather than a sprint. Patience, coordination, and adaptability will be key in overcoming the hurdles faced in vaccine distribution. Collaboration between nations, sharing of knowledge and resources, and a commitment to ensuring equitable access to vaccines globally are essential to bringing an end to the pandemic.

While disappointments and frustrations are understandable, it is important to acknowledge the unprecedented nature of this global vaccination campaign. The scientific achievement of developing safe and effective vaccines in record time should not be overshadowed by the challenges encountered in their distribution. With continued perseverance and collective global effort, humanity can eventually emerge victorious in the battle against COVID-19.",true
2050,Health activists try to attract dentists to rural areas.,"Dentist Lance Knight examines a patient for photographers during a photocall to launch the new in store dental service at British supermarket Sainsbury's, in Manchester, northern England on September 15, 2008 REUTERS/Phil Noble A shortage of dentists in rural Kansas and other states has left residents with little to smile about. A coalition formed in Kansas is pushing for legislative reforms to attract dental professionals, if not dentists themselves, to underserved areas. Kansas has no dentists in 14 of its 81 counties, leaving those residents with a choice of taking long drives or ignoring their teeth. The first option is expensive and time-consuming, the latter is ill-advised by dentists and doctors. “Dental care is about more than just teeth, it’s about the whole body,” said Stephanie Mullholland of a health care advocacy group called Kansas Action for Children. Poor care of teeth and gums can lead to infections detrimental to the heart and lungs while contributing to diabetes, strokes, low birth weights and other conditions, according to the surgeon general of the United States. The shortage of dentists is national in scope. Part of a recent $130 million package of health care grants announced by the Department of Health and Human Services includes $4.3 million for dental workforce needs in underserved regions. The shortage in rural Kansas is traced to multiple factors. Dentists shy away because of low rates of reimbursement for Medicaid patients, who are numerous in rural areas. Salaries are lower in rural regions. Kansas has no dental school. Finally, the average age of dentists in Kansas is 50. When they retire in rural areas, young dentists don’t replace them. Largely unsuccessful in prior efforts to lure more dentists to rural Kansas, the coalition called the Kansas Dental Project is now pushing for state legislation to allow licensing of “dental therapists” who would not only clean teeth but do extractions and fillings. They would work under the supervision of dentists, although the dentists may be in distant offices. Dental therapists could help address the dentist shortage the way licensed practical nurses filled a need in the 1950s and 1960s for medical care in areas without doctors, Mullholland said. “We use mid-level providers extensively on the medical side,” said Cathy Harding, executive director of the Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved. “Dental therapists care for patients in the same way on the dental side.” Dental therapists are used in Alaska and in more than 50 foreign countries, she said. Various states have taken different approaches. Maine voters just approved a $5 million bond issue to build the state’s first dental school and help dental clinics around the state. Other states have tried mobile dental clinics, offered college tuition and salary incentives for would-be dentists, and set up bi-state tuition and license reciprocity agreements.","COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts Show Promise in Reducing Infection Rates

As COVID-19 continues to proliferate across the globe, vaccination efforts have become the top priority for healthcare systems worldwide. Recent data suggests that these efforts are showing promise in reducing infection rates and bringing us one step closer to controlling the spread of the virus.

Numerous countries have initiated large-scale vaccination campaigns, aiming to inoculate as many people as possible. The key goal is to reach herd immunity, a scenario where enough individuals within a population are immune to a disease, consequently reducing its spread and protecting vulnerable groups. The vaccines currently authorized for emergency use have proven effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization caused by COVID-19.

A comprehensive study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analyzed infection rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. The findings demonstrated a significant reduction in cases among those who had received the vaccine when compared to those who hadn't. This emphasizes the importance of widespread vaccination as a crucial tool in curbing the transmission of the virus.

Furthermore, recent real-world evidence from countries like Israel and the United Kingdom showcases the effectiveness of vaccination in practice. These nations, which have achieved relatively high vaccination rates, have experienced a remarkable decline in infection rates, resulting in fewer hospitalizations and deaths. The success of their vaccination campaigns offers hope and serves as a blueprint for other countries striving to achieve similar outcomes.

In addition to lowering infection rates, COVID-19 vaccination plays a pivotal role in minimizing the risk of severe complications. According to research conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccinated individuals are less likely to require intensive care and ventilation compared to those who remain unvaccinated. This not only eases the pressure on healthcare systems but also saves lives.

While vaccinations have shown substantial benefits, vaccine hesitancy remains a challenge in some populations. Misinformation and concerns about side effects are among the primary reasons for hesitancy. However, health authorities and experts continue to emphasize the safety and efficacy of authorized vaccines. Rigorous testing, extensive monitoring systems, and transparent reporting have thus far revealed that severe side effects are extremely rare. The overall benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks associated with contracting COVID-19.

To address vaccine hesitancy and reach broader segments of the population, governments and healthcare providers have implemented robust public awareness campaigns. These initiatives aim to provide accurate information about the vaccines while debunking common myths and misconceptions. Additionally, community engagement programs have been established to address specific concerns and increase access to vaccinations within marginalized communities.

It is important to note that the fight against COVID-19 is far from over. Variants of the virus continue to emerge, and the global distribution of vaccines remains uneven. To effectively control the pandemic, it is crucial that vaccination efforts scale up globally and ensure equitable access to vaccines for all countries. This will not only protect individual populations but also prevent new variants from spreading.

In conclusion, the ongoing mass vaccination efforts against COVID-19 are yielding promising results in reducing infection rates and preventing severe illness. Data from various studies and real-world examples highlight the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns in curbing the spread of the virus. Despite challenges such as vaccine hesitancy and global disparities in distribution, these achievements serve as an encouraging reminder that we are making significant strides in our battle against the pandemic. The priority now lies in continuing our collective efforts to expand vaccination coverage, address hesitancy, and achieve global immunization, ultimately bringing an end to this unprecedented crisis.",true
4530,Boxed in? Warren confronts tough politics of health care.,"Persistent questions about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for universal health coverage have dominated her campaign in recent weeks. Warren has refused to answer, arguing that it’s more important to note that overall costs would fall for nearly everyone but large corporations and the wealthy. That hasn’t quelled the criticism and, recognizing the push for specifics isn’t going away, Warren is promising to soon unveil details about how she would cover the costs of what would be a massive new federal entitlement. The release will test Warren’s ability to navigate the Democratic primary as she balances the demands of progressives who are open to new taxes against skepticism from moderates who say such levies would doom her in a general election. “She’s trying to thread the needle between the electorate that wants a simple answer and the facts that she knows and that she has to live with at some point down the road,” said Jim McDermott, a former Democratic congressman from Washington state who spent most of his career trying to move a “single-payer” plan. With the first votes just over three months away, Warren could leave many disappointed. If she aligns with Sanders, who acknowledges taxes will have to go up, she could further alarm Democrats worried she’s pushing the party too far to the left. If she doesn’t, that could alienate progressives who may accuse her plan of not going far enough. And any combination of the two might leave virtually everyone else still confused — wondering how to make the program’s eye-popping math work. That Warren is having to address health care questions on such starkly political terms may recall another, early campaign test she flunked: releasing the results of a DNA test last fall. Meant to quiet critics who questioned her past claims to Native American heritage, the move angered tribal leaders and energized critics like President Donald Trump who still gleefully deride Warren as “Pocahontas.” Warren says that, far from having boxed herself in politically, she’s been working on her health care plan for months and still sees it as a winning issue. Her campaign has consulted experts, is reviewing Sanders’ funding options on universal coverage going back to his 2016 presidential run and says it will always stay true to Warren’s promises that health care costs rise for the rich and big firms while falling for “hard-working families.” One expert Warren’s team has consulted is Robert Pollin, a University of Massachusetts Amherst economist who supports Medicare for All and has called for partially helping to pay for it using a sales tax. “We should all pay something,” said Pollin, who is a past donor to both Warren and Sanders but declined to discuss the specifics of his conversations with Warren’s campaign. “You’re going to get health care with no premiums, no deductibles, no fear of bankruptcy if you have a health emergency.” Warren has refused to commit to the idea of everyone paying a little. But presenting the payment specifics she’s promised means necessarily grappling with the possibility of higher overall costs for the program, since making health care free for the patient would encourage people to use more services. Sara Collins, vice president for coverage and access with the nonpartisan Commonwealth Club, said the key involves changing how the health care tab is divided up among employers, government and individuals. “The overall growth in spending isn’t that great, but it’s the ‘Who pays for it?’ that really changes,” said Collins, adding that costs would shift to the federal government, meaning “taxes will likely have to go up.” More pitfalls may emerge as the Warren campaign tries to estimate Medicare for All’s cost. Since the final product would have to be approved by Congress, its contents are impossible to predict. A study released last week nonetheless estimated the government would need $2.7 trillion for Medicare for All to be fully implemented next year — more than half the current federal budget. Sanders’ campaign estimated that the universal health coverage plan he first introduced in 2016 would cost $14 trillion over the next decade. His estimates for the current race are far higher, though he now wants to offer more coverage. Unlike Warren, Sanders has already released payment options, including higher taxes on wealthy Americans and an employee payroll tax of 7.5%. But he’s also suggested a 4% “premium” on income that kicks in after the first $29,000 for a family of four — very much affecting the middle class. Warren could possibly avoid that by imposing co-pay rules or limiting what’s covered. Her plan may institute payroll taxes to transfer what employers already spend on employee health care through private insurance to government-run Medicare for All. But that would give federal authorities more control over employee health costs than employers, potentially affecting jobs. “If your plan for health care involves the perception, even if it’s not reality, that you’re going to take away something that people have worked very hard to maintain — then it would be very problematic,” said Brandon Dillon, former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party. Warren’s predicament is striking since she emerged as a front-runner alongside former Vice President Joe Biden by proudly “having a plan” for everything but arguably the 2020 race’s top issue. She’s also spent months deftly floating above questions about paying for her other ambitious proposals, including offering universal child care and tuition-free education at public universities while canceling existing student debt, by proposing a wealth tax on the ultra-rich. That proposal effectively became a piggy bank to cover the costs of her other promises. The wealth tax won’t be enough to pay for Medicare for All, though. Warren’s avoidance of the middle-class tax question has helped the issue linger as a political liability — and not just in Washington political circles. Peter Schweyer, a Democrat in Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives who is undecided in the presidential race, called pointed questions of Warren over Medicare for All during last week’s presidential debate “really good.” “She’ll need to figure out how to respond,” Schweyer said. ___ Associated Press writers David Eggert in Lansing, Mich., and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pa., contributed to this report.","COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Surpass 70% as Public Health Measures Show Promising Results

As the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic for over a year, public health measures and vaccination campaigns have made significant strides, with vaccination rates surpassing the 70% mark. This milestone brings hope for a return to normalcy, as the relentless efforts of healthcare professionals and government initiatives begin to bear fruit.

The global community has been relentless in its pursuit of immunization against the novel coronavirus. With numerous vaccines now available across the globe, vaccination campaigns have picked up pace, resulting in an impressive milestone of over 70% of the population receiving at least one dose.

These vaccination campaigns have been the linchpin of the fight against COVID-19. Governments and medical professionals have worked tirelessly to promote vaccine awareness and accessibility, ensuring that even the most remote areas have access to life-saving shots. This achievement is a testament to the collective effort of scientists, healthcare workers, and citizens who understand the importance of vaccination in curbing the spread of the virus.

Furthermore, these efforts have yielded promising results. Countries with high vaccination rates have witnessed a decline in new infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Hospitals that were once overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients are now experiencing lower patient numbers, giving healthcare systems some much-needed respite.

Public health measures such as mask mandates, social distancing, and hygiene practices have also played a vital role in curbing the virus's transmission. These measures, combined with vaccination campaigns, have proven to be effective tools in fighting the pandemic. As more people get vaccinated, the need for stringent restrictions may gradually ease, breathing new life into local economies and rejuvenating social interactions.

While the progress made so far is commendable, experts urge vigilance and continued adherence to public health guidelines. Variants of concern, such as the Delta variant, remind us that the battle is not yet won. Vaccination rates must continue to climb to protect vulnerable populations and prevent the emergence of new variants that could pose a threat to global health.

In response to this urgency, governments are implementing innovative strategies to boost vaccination rates further. Initiatives such as mobile vaccine clinics, door-to-door outreach, and educational campaigns are being employed to ensure no one is left behind in the race against the virus. Vaccine incentives, such as cash rewards or additional vacation days, have also been successful in encouraging vaccine-hesitant individuals to take the shot.

It is important to address vaccine hesitancy by dispelling myths, providing accurate information, and engaging with communities to understand their concerns. Medical professionals and trusted public figures can play a crucial role in disseminating information and addressing vaccine-related queries.

As we celebrate the progress made on the vaccination front, it is imperative not to neglect other aspects of public health. Mental well-being, long-term effects of COVID-19, and the importance of healthcare infrastructure must remain a priority. Efforts must be channeled towards supporting mental health services, offering post-COVID care, and strengthening healthcare systems to ensure resilience for future challenges.

The journey to beat COVID-19 has been arduous, but the collective efforts of medical professionals, researchers, government bodies, and citizens around the world are starting to show results. It is a reminder that, together, we can mitigate the devastating impact of the virus and pave the way for a healthier and more resilient future.",true
7895,UK's Royal Mint making coronavirus protective gear for health staff.,"Engineers at the Mint created the visors after finding a basic design online and developing medically approved prototypes within 48 hours at their production site in Wales. The first visors are already in use at a hospital in Wales and mass production will start on Saturday morning, with several hundred coming on the first day and increasing numbers after that. The Mint says it can produce thousands of visors per day if it can get enough parts and is now appealing to manufacturers across the UK to help it source enough clear plastic, which is currently in short supply. The simple design comprises a clear plastic shield which covers the worker’s face, held in place by a piece of elastic. Britain’s publicly funded national health service, the NHS, has received much public support during the coronavirus outbreak, with government health authorities adopting the slogan “Stay Home, Protect The NHS, Save Lives”. People all over the country took to their balconies and doorsteps on Thursday evening to applaud health workers who are battling the spread of the coronavirus. “My sister works for the NHS and it really focuses your mind on the challenges they are facing,” said Leighton John, director of operations at the Royal Mint. “We set our engineers the task of developing essential medical equipment which could be easily made on site – within seven hours they’d created a medical visor, and within 48 hours it was approved for mass manufacture,” John said. As the virus sweeps the country, the Mint is the latest in a number of companies taking on new operations as part of a nationwide effort to support the NHS. Vacuum cleaner company Dyson was recruited to supply hospitals with 10,000 medical ventilators designed at breakneck speed ahead of an expected surge of cases, and outsourcer Capita announced on Friday it was working with the government to provide coronavirus testing sites.","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted public health around the world, forcing governments and healthcare systems to adapt in unprecedented ways. While progress has been made in tackling the virus through vaccination campaigns and public health measures, an increasing concern has emerged with the rise of COVID-19 variants. These variants are proving to be more transmissible and potentially more resistant to existing treatments and vaccines, posing a new threat to global efforts in controlling the spread of the virus.

One such variant that has caused significant alarm is the Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2. First identified in India in late 2020, this variant has quickly become dominant in several countries and has prompted increased vigilance from health authorities worldwide. Early studies indicate that the Delta variant is spreading approximately 60% more easily compared to the Alpha variant, which was previously observed as one of the most contagious strains of the virus.

The rapid transmission of the Delta variant has led to an upsurge in new COVID-19 cases in areas where it has taken hold. In several countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia, the Delta variant has fueled a resurgence of infections, reversing previous progress in reducing case numbers. Health officials warn that if left unchecked, the Delta variant could lead to overwhelming hospitalizations and strain healthcare systems already burdened by previous waves of the virus.

One concerning aspect of the Delta variant is its potential impact on vaccine effectiveness. While authorized vaccines have shown efficacy against various COVID-19 strains, recent studies suggest that the Delta variant may partially evade the immune response triggered by some vaccines. Researchers from the United Kingdom have found that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine provide strong protection against hospitalization due to the Delta variant. However, the AstraZeneca vaccine appears to be less effective, particularly after only one dose.

This revelation has raised concerns among leaders and health experts globally. Many countries, including the United States, have intensified vaccination efforts to ensure individuals are fully vaccinated with two doses. Boosting vaccination rates is crucial for preventing the further spread of the Delta variant, protecting vulnerable populations, and reducing severe illness and death.

Public health officials also stress the importance of continued adherence to proven preventive measures such as wearing masks, maintaining physical distance, and proper hand hygiene. These measures remain effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 and its variants.

The emergence of the Delta variant serves as a reminder that the fight against the pandemic is far from over. It highlights the need for globally coordinated efforts to monitor and respond to emerging variants swiftly. By closely tracking the evolution of the virus through genomic surveillance, scientists can provide early warnings on new strains, allowing public health strategies to adapt accordingly.

In conclusion, the rising prevalence of the Delta variant poses challenges for public health authorities worldwide. The increased transmissibility and potential resistance to existing vaccines emphasize the urgent need for comprehensive vaccination campaigns, continued use of preventive measures, and vigilance in detecting and managing COVID-19 variants. The battle against this virus requires ongoing collaboration between governments, healthcare systems, and communities to safeguard public health and mitigate the impact of future waves of infections.",true
2896,Long-term efficacy of Chelsea drug may pose problems for FDA.,"A review, posted on the FDA’s website on Friday, comes ahead of a meeting on January 14 of outside medical experts who will discuss the drug and recommend whether it should be approved. The FDA generally follows the advice of its advisory panels. The drug, droxidopa, is designed to treat neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH), a rare, chronic type of low blood pressure that occurs on standing. Arguments in favor of approval include “strong evidence” that the drug confers at least one week of benefit, the staff review found. Arguments against approval include a lack of evidence that the benefit is durable over a longer period of time. The disorder is associated with certain neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease; multiple system atrophy; and pure autonomic failure — conditions which can impair the body’s involuntary functions such as blood pressure and heart rate.","COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Underway: Ensuring Equitable Access for All

The global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic has reached a significant milestone as countries around the world launch mass vaccination campaigns. With multiple vaccines receiving regulatory approval, experts agree that widespread immunization is essential to control the virus's spread and eventually bring an end to the ongoing health crisis.

However, as nations begin to roll out their vaccination programs, concerns about equitable access and distribution have taken center stage. The challenge lies in ensuring fair allocation of vaccines while addressing disparities in healthcare infrastructure and vulnerable population groups.

To tackle these challenges, governments, international organizations, and healthcare professionals have come together, prioritizing key principles such as fairness, transparency, and inclusivity. In many countries, priority groups are being identified based on risk factors and individuals' roles within society.

Frontline healthcare workers and elderly populations are often among the first to receive vaccinations. These groups face a higher risk of exposure due to their work or age-related vulnerabilities. In addition, prioritizing them helps safeguard healthcare systems and protect those most at risk from severe illness or mortality.

Nevertheless, equitable vaccine distribution goes beyond prioritizing specific groups. It requires addressing socioeconomic factors that may limit access to healthcare, a concept known as ""health equity."" Communities disproportionately affected by the pandemic, such as low-income neighborhoods and minority groups, must be prioritized to ensure fair distribution and prevent further exacerbation of existing health disparities.

In some countries, mobile vaccination clinics are being established in underserved communities, enabling easier access for those who might face barriers like transportation or limited healthcare facilities nearby. These initiatives aim not only to ensure equity but also to rebuild trust in public health systems within marginalized communities that have historically been underserved.

Moreover, global collaboration plays a crucial role in achieving equitable vaccine distribution. Through initiatives such as COVAX, an alliance working towards fair access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide, wealthier countries are contributing funds to support low-income nations' vaccination efforts. This solidarity is instrumental in preventing a scenario where only affluent nations acquire vaccines while others lag behind, perpetuating the global health crisis.

Communication and outreach campaigns also play a pivotal role in ensuring equitable vaccine distribution. Governments and healthcare organizations must address vaccine hesitancy, particularly among minority groups. By partnering with community leaders, addressing concerns, and providing culturally competent information, authorities can build trust and encourage broader vaccine acceptance.

Furthermore, the development of clear guidelines and protocols is essential for fair and efficient distribution. These plans should prioritize vulnerable populations, outline strategies for distributing surplus doses, and establish mechanisms to monitor progress and adjust distribution strategies as needed.

While significant strides have been made in rolling out vaccines, challenges remain. The limited global supply of doses poses a significant hurdle in achieving equitable distribution. Vaccine manufacturing and distribution capacity must be ramped up to meet demand and ensure worldwide access to safe and effective vaccines.

In conclusion, achieving equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is vital for controlling the pandemic and mitigating its impact on all communities. Prioritizing vulnerable populations, addressing healthcare disparities, increasing vaccine availability, and fostering international collaboration are essential aspects of this endeavor. By staying committed to fairness, transparency, and inclusivity, we can build a healthier and more resilient future for all.",true
128,"In new headache, WeWork says it found cancer-causing chemical in its phone booths.","The company, which abandoned plans for an initial public offering last month after investors questioned its mounting losses and the way it was being run, said in an email to its tenants on Monday that the chemical could pose a cancer-risk if there is long-term exposure. After a tenant complained of odor and eye irritation, WeWork began testing and based on the results took 1,600 phone booths out of service, the company said in the email to tenants, which it calls members. An additional 700 booths are closed while more testing is conducted, it said. All the phone booths closed were installed over the past several months, WeWork said. “The safety and well-being of our members is our top priority and we are working to remedy this situation as quickly as possible,” WeWork said in a statement. More costs are the last thing needed at the company, which some analysts say is fast running out of cash. WeWork declined to comment on the cost of testing and replacing the booths. It is currently in talks for a multi-billion dollar rescue deal that could lead to its largest shareholder, Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), taking control, two people familiar with the matter said. WeWork is also talking to JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) over a possible debt package, they said. WeWork declined to identify the manufacturer of the phone booths. “Long-term exposure to formaldehyde, such as that experienced by workers in jobs who experience high concentrations over many years, has been associated with certain types of cancers,” WeWork told tenants in the email. In 1987, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classified formaldehyde as a probable human carcinogen under conditions of unusually high or prolonged exposure. Some studies since then suggested that formaldehyde exposure is associated with certain types of cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute. A tenant, who did not wish to be identified, said she was worried about the risk of cancer as she had spent hundreds of hours inside phone booths at a San Francisco WeWork that has the problem. Phone booths are popular in WeWork’s open-plan offices as they provide privacy and noise reduction, the tenant said.","COVID-19 Vaccines: A Global Milestone in the Fight Against the Pandemic

The development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines represent a pivotal moment in the global battle against the pandemic. With several vaccines now approved and being administered around the world, there is hope that an end to this health crisis is within reach.

Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus in late 2019, scientists and researchers have been working tirelessly to develop effective and safe vaccines. Pharmaceutical companies collaborated with governments, regulatory bodies, and international organizations to accelerate the vaccine development process without compromising on safety protocols.

In November 2020, the first interim results from Pfizer-BioNTech's phase 3 vaccine trial were announced, showcasing promising efficacy rates of approximately 95%. Following close behind, Moderna reported equally remarkable efficacy rates for their vaccine candidate. These positive findings were met with enthusiasm and relief globally, signaling a ray of hope amidst the dark cloud of the pandemic.

As the vaccines underwent rigorous review processes with various regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), concerns were raised about ensuring equitable access for countries worldwide. Recognizing the urgency, initiatives such as COVAX were established to facilitate the fair distribution of vaccines, particularly to low-income countries that might struggle to procure sufficient doses independently.

In December 2020, the United Kingdom became the first country to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to its citizens outside of clinical trials. Other nations swiftly followed suit, launching mass vaccination campaigns. Healthcare workers, elderly individuals, and those with comorbidities were prioritized to receive the initial doses.

The vaccination rollout, however, has not been without challenges. Production and distribution bottlenecks led to delays in some regions, frustrating efforts to inoculate the population quickly. Countries like India, known for their vaccine manufacturing capacity, stepped up production to meet global demand. Despite these challenges, the drive to vaccinate continues, and governments are working tirelessly to streamline distribution systems and ramp up vaccine availability.

Addressing vaccine hesitancy has also been a significant concern. Misinformation and skepticism surrounding the vaccines have fueled doubts in certain communities, leading to reduced uptake. Governments and health organizations have launched public awareness campaigns to dispel myths and provide accurate information about vaccine safety and efficacy. Community engagement and targeted communication have been crucial to address fears and encourage widespread vaccination.

As more people receive their COVID-19 vaccines, early data is providing encouraging signs. Real-world studies are demonstrating the vaccines' ability to significantly reduce severe illness, hospitalization rates, and mortality. The vaccines offer hope not just for individual protection but also for curbing transmission and achieving herd immunity.

Nevertheless, it is important to maintain cautious optimism. Vaccines alone cannot vanquish the pandemic. Continued adherence to preventive measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and hand hygiene remains essential, particularly as new coronavirus variants emerge.

The global quest for equitable vaccine access is an ongoing challenge that demands collaboration and solidarity. The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for fair distribution, stressing that no one is safe until everyone is safe. International organizations, governments, and pharmaceutical companies must work together to ensure sufficient supplies reach all corners of the world, including marginalized communities.

In conclusion, the development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines mark a turning point in the fight against the pandemic. Despite hurdles in manufacturing, distribution, and vaccine hesitancy, vaccines offer us a glimmer of hope. It is now our collective responsibility to support equitable access and continue practicing preventive measures diligently. Together, we can bring an end to this global health crisis and build a healthier and more resilient world.",true
2432,Fitness experts extol machine-less workout.,"Despite a gym floor bulging with weight-lifting equipment, fitness experts said the only thing people need to push, pull and lift is the weight of their own body. “If more people knew you could get a good physique using your body as a bar bell, they could take matters into their own hands,” said Bret Contreras, author of “Bodyweight Strength Training Anatomy,” a guide to bodyweight-only workouts aimed at everyone from the exercise-challenged to the personal trainer. Known as “the Glute Guy,” Arizona-based Contreras has been resistance training for 21 years. But in high school, he couldn’t do a push-up. “At 15 I was so skinny people used to make jokes,” the 37-year old said. “I just got so tired of being made fun of I decided to take charge.”  Often thought of as a stepping stone to weight training, bodyweight training can be a complete, whole body workout in itself, Contreras said. Once the person masters the simpler version of a push-up, squat, or chin-up, a more advanced version can be tackled, often with a little help from the living room furniture. “Find things in the environment: a table to get underneath, hold on to the sides of and then pull the body upward; a rafter for a pull-up,” he said. “To work your glutes (buttocks muscles), all you need is a couch.”  Contreras recommends the beginner start with 15 minutes a day and increase over time. “It doesn’t have to be intimidating,” he said. “You could do a 20-minute workout three times a week and have an incredible physique, so long as you push hard and keep challenging yourself.”  Bodyweight exercises return people to the way they move naturally, according to Lisa Wheeler, national creative manager of group fitness at Equinox, the upscale chain of fitness centers. “We squat, lunge, crawl, reach,” she said, adding that a bodyweight class at Equinox is called “Animal Flow” because its crab crawls, lunges and swings were inspired by the primal movement patterns of man and beast. “Bodyweight training is great for mobility, stability and creating movement patterns,” she said. “You want to build a strong foundation, be stable around the shoulders, hips and spine.”  Because the load doesn’t change, progression is achieved by changing the center of gravity of the exerciser or the complexity of the movement. Another challenge, she said, is getting enough pull to match the push of most bodyweight exercises. “Bodyweight training can make everything else better,” she said. “Dancers, moms, we all live push-pull now.”  Jessica Matthews, an exercise physiologist with the American Council on Exercise, said bodyweight training blends with the trend toward functional training, or training that mimics the way we move in everyday life, as opposed to the older bodybuilder model of targeting one muscle group at a time. “Our body is one kinetic chain, everything moves together, so most everyday exercises will move multiple muscle groups,” she said. Matthews said not only can bodyweight training be done anytime, anywhere, it also works easily into popular interval training, circuit and boot camp workouts. “Using bodyweight exercises allow more of a cardiovascular component because you can move rapidly from one exercise to the next,” Matthews said. So are machines a thing of the past? “I think there’s a place for everything,” she said, “For some people a fixed path might be the way to go. It boils down to having proper joint stability and quality range of movement, then adding load. Form is imperative.”","Biden Administration Expands Vaccine Eligibility to All Adults in Effort to Curb COVID-19 Surge

In a significant step towards ending the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden administration has announced the expansion of vaccine eligibility to all adults across the United States. The decision comes as a response to the recent surge in cases and aims to accelerate the vaccination campaign and protect as many people as possible.

President Joe Biden, in a press conference held yesterday, stressed the urgency of the situation and emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated. ""We are in a race against time,"" he said, ""and expanding vaccine eligibility is a critical move to save lives and regain control over this virus.""

As of now, every state will be required to open up appointments for anyone aged 18 and older by May 1st. This aligns with President Biden's previous goal of making vaccines available to all American adults by the summer. The president expressed confidence that this expanded eligibility will bring the nation closer to reaching the administration's target of vaccinating at least 200 million Americans by the end of his first 100 days in office.

The decision to widen eligibility follows the success of the vaccine rollout thus far, where a substantial number of high-risk groups, including healthcare workers, the elderly, and individuals with underlying medical conditions, have already received their shots. With increasing supplies and more vaccination sites opening up across the country, health experts believe it is the right time to offer everyone a chance to get immunized.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, hailed the move as a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19. He emphasized that vaccination remains the most effective tool to prevent severe illness, hospitalization, and death. ""Expanding eligibility will not only protect individuals but also contribute to reducing community transmission,"" he stated. Dr. Fauci further urged eligible individuals to schedule their appointments promptly to build immunity within the population and curb the ongoing surge.

To support states in this expanded immunization effort, the federal government has pledged to increase vaccine supply to state and local health departments. It will also launch community vaccination centers nationwide to ensure equitable access for all eligible individuals. Additionally, the administration plans to collaborate with pharmacies and healthcare providers to extend vaccination opportunities outside traditional sites, such as by administering shots at workplaces and pop-up clinics in underserved areas.

While opening up vaccine eligibility to all adults is undoubtedly a major step forward, health authorities caution against complacency. They stress the need for continued adherence to public health measures, such as wearing masks, practicing physical distancing, and avoiding large gatherings. Vaccination alone cannot eradicate the virus, but it can significantly reduce its impact on communities.

In the coming weeks, experts anticipate that the expansion of eligibility will push the demand for vaccines to even greater heights. The administration urges patience and advises Americans not to panic if securing an appointment immediately proves challenging. With additional doses arriving weekly, officials assure the public that everyone who wishes to be vaccinated will have the opportunity to do so.

As the vaccination campaign gains momentum, policymakers and health officials remain cautiously optimistic that normalcy may return sooner than anticipated. However, until a significant portion of the population is fully vaccinated and the virus is under control, the battle against COVID-19 continues. It is now up to individuals, communities, and the government to work together, following the recommended precautions and getting vaccinated, to overcome this unprecedented global health crisis.",true
6532,Future is in doubt for cheaper versions of biologic drugs.,"Called “biosimilars,” they are near-copies of complex and expensive biologic drugs to treat cancer, rare diseases and autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and colitis. But U.S. sales have been so limited that their future is in doubt. Already, one company has scrapped nearly all its biosimilar development projects. Worst-case scenario? Drugmakers could abandon biosimilar development, and makers of original biologic drugs could keep raising their six-figure-a-year prices indefinitely. Two years ago, the independent policy research group RAND Health predicted biosimilars would save the U.S. roughly $54 billion from 2017 through 2026. That’s looking optimistic. “This is a make-or-break period,” said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who led the Food and Drug Administration until April. “My fear is that some of the biosimilar-makers ... will say, ‘We’ll just go back to doing other things,’” and other drugmakers won’t enter the niche. Leigh Purvis, AARP’s director of health services research, says the original biologic drugmakers “could kill this market before it ever takes off, and we desperately need it.” THE PROMISE Biosimilars are akin to generic drugs, but true generics aren’t possible with biologic drugs. Pills are easily duplicated by mixing chemicals. Getting a generic version of a brand-name pill approved requires spending about $2 million and two years to conduct lab tests and show it’s chemically equivalent to the original medication. Manufacturing costs just pennies a pill. Biologic drugs, on the other hand, are made by manipulating living cells to produce a specific protein. They treat disorders often caused by faulty genes or immune systems, and they must be injected or delivered by infusion. The complex process needed to grow and purify the proteins means a copycat biosimilar will never be identical to the original drug. But it also can’t have “clinically meaningful” differences. Getting approval can take five to nine years of lab and patient testing, and cost over $100 million. A decade ago, Congress passed a law meant to encourage development of cheaper biosimilars. But the makers of the original biologic drugs have fought hard to block the new rivals, with stacks of successive patents, lawsuits and rebates to insurers. The result? Even drugmakers with the expertise and resources to produce biosimilars are mostly thwarted. In the U.S., that is. In Europe, monopoly-protecting patents generally don’t last as long as in the U.S. and government-run health systems have favored biosimilars in exchange for steep discounts. Biosimilars hit Europe in 2006. Now 54 are available at discounts up to 80 percent. In the U.S., the FDA has approved 24 biosimilars, nearly all since 2015. Just 11 of them are actually for sale, generally at 15% to 35% below the original drug’s price. Those discounts are easily matched by original biologic makers who prefer insurers give them a smaller piece of the pie than nothing. Biosimilars have been approved in the U.S. for five biologic best-sellers on the market as long as 22 years: Humira and Enbrel, for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and other autoimmune disorders, and the cancer drugs Herceptin, Rituxan and Avastin. However, their biosimilars can’t be sold in the U.S. due to litigation and multiple, monopoly-extending patents. The brands have monthly list prices of over $5,000 to nearly $13,000. Health plans pay much less, but even well-insured patients must pay a big portion — or the full price until they cover their plan deductible. HOW WE GOT HERE Drugmakers have been harnessing scientific advances to create targeted biologic drugs, many for cancer and rare conditions without good treatments. Their executives predicted insurers wouldn’t balk at high prices because the patient numbers aren’t big. But as more people took biologic drugs and companies increased prices 6% to 20% every year, insurers and middlemen called prescription benefit managers limited patients’ access. They also set high copayments for many patients. Biosimilars were seen as financial salvation. But given their limited sales to date, the FDA is trying to enable faster approval. In May, it issued guidelines to enable biosimilar-makers to show their products are interchangeable with an original biologic drug. Pharmacies then could substitute a biosimilar for a brand-name biologic, as happens routinely with generic pills. Cancer patient David Mitchell, who founded the advocacy group Patients for Affordable Drugs, says biologic drugmakers are exploiting the system, despite having at least 12 years of market exclusivity. “We have patients who say, ‘I’ve been taking this drug for 15 or 20 years and there’s still no generic,’” Mitchell notes. He says the group also hears frequently from patients on biologic drugs “who are struggling or can’t afford them.” Chuck Pope, a former machinist from Derry, Pennsylvania, has had rheumatoid arthritis since 2005 and took Enbrel for seven years. He said it prevented flare-ups of the joint-destroying autoimmune disorder, enabling him to keep working long hours. Then shoulder injuries forced him onto disability and cost Pope his employer’s “excellent insurance.” Pope said he can’t afford the thousands of dollars Enbrel would cost him under his Medicare plan. “My body’s just totally disintegrating because of the RA,” which causes irreversible damage, said Pope, 64. “Wouldn’t it be more logical to lower the price and have more people on the drug?” BIOSIMILAR BARRIERS Last year, the U.S. spent $126 billion on biologic drugs, only 2% of it on biosimilars, according to the health data firm IQVIA. Gottlieb, the recently departed FDA commissioner, blames the slow uptake partly on doctors hesitant to switch patients to unfamiliar alternatives. He also points to barriers erected by the companies behind name-brand biologic drugs. Their tactics include disparaging biosimilars as inferior, luring patients with coupons subsidizing their copayments, getting successive patents to extend their monopolies, and giving rebates to insurance plans which cover their biologic drugs but exclude rival biosimilars. A report released Wednesday by a biosimilars trade group estimated the U.S. health care system lost $7.6 billion in possible savings since 2015 due to patent walls delaying sales of approved biosimilars. Health plans are reluctant to take up biosimilars, because that would instantly end their big rebates, Gottlieb said. Such exclusionary contracts have stifled sales of Inflectra, Pfizer’s biosimilar of Johnson & Johnson’s $5 billion-a-year autoimmune disorder drug, Remicade. Since launching in November 2016, Inflectra’s U.S. sales totaled $438 million, though it’s priced 25% below Remicade’s $2,335-per-month list price. Pfizer is suing J&J for “unlawful conduct” that blocks competition. J&J says it simply offered rebate options health plans requested. In October, biosimilar versions of the world’s most lucrative drug, Humira, hit Europe. Humira, which treats psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders, launched 17 years ago and brought maker AbbVie $20 billion in 2018 sales, two-thirds from the U.S. Seven drugmakers have Humira biosimilars approved or awaiting approval in the U.S., but none are expected soon. AbbVie sued each rival to block sales, claiming they would infringe Humira patents. All seven companies eventually settled, agreeing to pay AbbVie royalties so they can start selling biosimilar versions — in 2023. Boehringer Ingelheim, the last company to settle, had alleged AbbVie “improperly created a ‘patent thicket,’ comprising more than a hundred overlapping and non-inventive patents, for the sole purpose of extending its monopoly far beyond the expiration of its core patent for Humira in 2016.” AbbVie wouldn’t discuss Humira. But at a September conference, Chief Financial Officer William Chase said, “You’ve seen us execute very nicely with our legal strategy” to delay U.S. competition. Meanwhile, AbbVie has raised Humira’s U.S. monthly list price from $1,524 in 2009 to $5,174, according to figures from health data firm Elsevier. Makers of Avastin, Herceptin, Rituxan and Enbrel likewise raised their list prices 50% to 200% over that decade. DIM FUTURE? Drugmakers are obligated to maximize profits for shareholders, and hiking prices in the U.S., where they make the lion’s share of revenue, is a sure way of helping their bottom line. Price experts including Dr. Peter Bach of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York recently proposed scrapping biosimilars, saying they can’t succeed due to biologic drugs’ complexity and the nation’s for-profit health care system. They suggest that after biologic drugs have enjoyed their 12-year monopoly, their makers then sell them at cost plus a reasonable profit, set by an independent agency. Analyst Steve Brozak, president of WBB Securities, believes it will take another recession and a surge of unemployed, uninsured patients for the government to enact major changes to boost biosimilar use. Even if biosimilar access improves, few patients will see big savings, predicts Michael Kleinrock, research director at IQVIA. Insurers and prescription benefit managers will get those. “Many people will still have to pay up to their deductible” or out-of-pocket maximum, he says. Kleinrock sees bigger problems: Only about 20 biologic drugs have the billions in annual sales making it worthwhile to develop biosimilar rivals. And biosimilars of drugs created years ago will lose favor as improved, next-generation biologic medicines arrive. “If there’s less reward, there’s less incentive,” he says. ___ Follow Linda A.

A recently conducted study has indicated the need for COVID-19 vaccine boosters to ensure long-term protection against the virus. The research, led by a team of scientists from renowned institutions, sheds light on the waning immunity over time and the potential risks posed by emerging variants.

As vaccination efforts continue worldwide, concerns have been raised regarding the duration of protection conferred by current COVID-19 vaccines. While initial studies demonstrated high efficacy rates, questions remain about the level of protection against evolving strains of the virus and the longevity of immunity provided.

The study, published in a leading medical journal, examined data from over 10,000 fully vaccinated individuals across multiple regions. Researchers tracked these individuals' antibody levels and their response to various SARS-CoV-2 variants over the course of several months following vaccination.

The findings revealed a decline in antibody levels over time, suggesting that immunity from vaccination may decrease after six to eight months. Moreover, the study highlighted the reduced effectiveness of vaccines against certain emerging variants, particularly the Delta variant, known for its increased transmissibility.

Dr. Sarah Thompson, one of the lead researchers, explained that while the vaccines still provide significant protection, additional doses or booster shots may be necessary to maintain robust immunity given the ongoing evolution of the virus. ""These findings underscore the importance of staying vigilant and adapting our vaccination strategies accordingly,"" she emphasized.

Public health officials have closely monitored data on breakthrough infections, instances where vaccinated individuals contract the virus. Such cases have been relatively rare, as the vaccines continue to offer strong protection against severe illness and hospitalization. However, breakthrough infections have primarily affected those vaccinated earlier in the rollout process.

Based on the study's outcomes, experts are urging governments and health agencies to consider implementing vaccine booster campaigns, prioritizing vulnerable populations such as the elderly, healthcare workers, and individuals with compromised immune systems. These booster shots aim to enhance the immune response and provide prolonged protection against COVID-19.

Dr. Anthony Johnson, a prominent infectious disease specialist, believes that booster campaigns should be implemented as soon as possible but handled cautiously to ensure equitable distribution. He said, ""We must strike a balance between providing necessary booster shots for those at risk while ensuring global vaccine equity, addressing disparities in access that exist worldwide.""

However, critics of the study caution against making hasty decisions, arguing that more research is needed before conclusively recommending booster doses. They contend that current vaccines still offer substantial protection against severe disease and hospitalization, adding that limited global vaccine supply would make massive booster campaigns impractical.

Regardless, ongoing monitoring and data collection are crucial to informing public health policies during this critical phase of the pandemic. Experts agree that vaccination remains the most potent tool in combating COVID-19, with booster shots potentially serving as an important component of maintaining resilient immunity.

As researchers and policymakers continue to grapple with evolving knowledge about COVID-19, the study results presented here serve as a valuable contribution to the ongoing dialogue surrounding vaccination strategies. The findings prompt careful consideration on the need for vaccine boosters to extend protection against emerging variants and waning immunity.",true
5844,Oklahoma follows national trend in increase in sex diseases.,"The Oklahoma State Department of Health says chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis cases rose from 29,716 in 2016 to 31,779 in 2017. The health department announcement came after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday that there were 2.3 million cases of STDs in 2017, an increase of more than 200,000 from the year before. The diseases can be cured with antibiotics. Left untreated, they can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, and increased risk of the virus that causes AIDS. The health department encourages regular testing for STDs, having protected sex, limiting the number of sexual partners and avoiding the use of shared needles.","New Study Shows COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness in Older Adults

A recent study has found promising results regarding the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in older adults. The research, which examined a sample group of individuals aged 65 and above, revealed that the vaccines provided a high level of protection against severe illness and hospitalization due to the virus.

The study, conducted by a team of scientists from a renowned medical institute, analyzed data from over 10,000 older adults who had received one of the three authorized COVID-19 vaccines. The findings indicated that the vaccine's efficacy remained consistent across all age groups within this demographic.

Dr. Sarah Johnson, the lead researcher of the study, explained that their objective was to assess the real-world impact of these vaccines on older adults. Previous clinical trials primarily focused on younger populations, leaving some uncertainty about how effective the vaccines would be for the elderly who are more prone to severe COVID-19 outcomes.

The study found that after receiving two doses of the vaccine, the participants' risk of developing severe symptoms or requiring hospitalization due to COVID-19 decreased significantly. In fact, among those who received both doses, hospitalization rates dropped by an impressive 85%.

Additionally, the research team monitored breakthrough infections among the vaccinated individuals. They discovered that even though a small percentage of fully vaccinated older adults did contract COVID-19, the infections were mild, with minimal hospitalizations recorded.

Dr. Johnson emphasized the importance of these findings, as they highlight the crucial role vaccination plays in protecting vulnerable populations like older adults. She urged everyone in this age group to get vaccinated as soon as they have the opportunity, emphasizing that vaccines are a vital tool in the battle against the pandemic.

These encouraging results align with previous studies that demonstrated how COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death in various populations. While breakthrough infections can still occur, the data indicates that vaccinated individuals are significantly less likely to experience severe disease outcomes.

The study's findings also hold broader implications for public health strategies. The protection provided by vaccines becomes increasingly important as new variants of the virus emerge. By vaccinating a high percentage of older adults, communities can limit viral transmission and decrease the risk of overwhelming healthcare systems.

Health officials have seen a positive trend in vaccine uptake among older adults since these age groups were prioritized during the initial vaccination rollout. However, some barriers remain, including vaccine hesitancy and accessibility issues. Efforts are underway to address these concerns through targeted outreach campaigns and mobile vaccination clinics to ensure equitable vaccine distribution.

As the world continues the battle against the ongoing pandemic, scientific research like this study plays a vital role in informing public health policies. The evidence supports the message that vaccines are both safe and highly effective in protecting older adults from severe COVID-19 outcomes. It is crucial to maintain momentum in the vaccination campaign to maximize protection not just for older adults but for everyone in the community.",true
1597,"Expectant couples avoiding Latin America, other Zika hotspots.","Airlines and hotel chains say it is too early to tell if the Zika epidemic is affecting bookings. But some “babymooners” - parents-to-be taking last-hurrah vacations - have backed out of trips and changed itineraries. “There’s been a lot of cancellations,” said Lauren Machowsky, a travel advisor at New York-based SmartFlyer. “Some people are freaked out.”   Machowsky, who is herself expecting a child and called off a planned vacation to Anguilla, said she is redirecting a lot of people to Florida and pointing clients to travel warnings issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “I refer them to the CDC website and say, ‘Listen, this is my experience. I was going away and had to cancel,’” Machowsky said. On Monday, the World Health Organization declared the Zika outbreak an emergency because of evidence that the mosquito-borne virus is linked to a spike in birth defects in Brazil. The current outbreak has spread to at least 25 countries and territories, most of them in the Americas. The CDC has advised pregnant women to avoid travel to areas with an active Zika outbreak. Parenting website babycenter.com asked pregnant readers with plans to travel to Zika-affected areas if they would change course. About half of 1,118 respondents said they planned to cancel, and 27 percent said they were keeping their plans. The rest were undecided. New Hampshire-based travel agent Darcy Allen, of Travel by Darcy, said she’s had a handful of cancellations and estimated 80 percent of her babymoon clients are avoiding Mexico. “It’s certainly a factor in deciding where they want to go,” said Allen. In another sign of Zika’s impact on travelers, sales of trip cancellation insurance have surged among people booking Latin American vacations, RoamRight, a top U.S. provider, told Reuters on Monday. Newlyweds hoping to start a family also are cautiously evaluating honeymoon options, said New Jersey-based Mindy Gilbert of My Vacation Lady. “I have been asking personal questions like, ‘Are you pregnant? Do you plan on conceiving,’ - something I’ve never asked before,” she said. One couple that had hoped to spend their honeymoon in Mexico’s Riviera Maya is now waiting to see how the virus situation develops, she said. Several travel agents said they were steering clients toward Europe and Hawaii. Ilonka Molijn, founder of Netherlands-based BabyMoon Travel, said visiting Mexico and the Caribbean was not a huge draw for her clients before the Zika outbreak, but now “there isn’t any interest in it at all.”  Concerns are extending beyond babymooners and honeymooners. Florida-based Travel Planners Inc owner Marieanne Syverson said 70 percent of her clients in January - only a small portion of whom were honeymooners - had asked about Zika. A few are rethinking their plans, she said, but she’s had no cancellations. “People are considering different destinations, absolutely,” she said. “Those who were thinking of Puerto Rico or Brazil for Carnival and the Olympics are thinking maybe they shouldn’t go there.”","New COVID-19 Variants Pose Increased Threat, Experts Warn

Multiple new variants of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, are spreading rapidly worldwide, posing an increased threat to public health. Experts have raised concerns over these variants as they may be more transmissible and potentially impact the effectiveness of available vaccines.

One such variant, known as B.1.1.7 or the UK variant, was first identified in the United Kingdom in December 2020. It has since spread to numerous countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. Recent studies suggest that this variant is up to 70% more contagious than previous strains. While there is no evidence to suggest it causes more severe illness, its rapid transmission can lead to a surge in cases, overwhelming healthcare systems.

Scientists are also closely monitoring the South African variant, named B.1.351. This variant carries several genetic mutations in the spike protein, which could potentially enable it to evade certain antibodies, reducing the efficacy of currently available vaccines. Preliminary data suggests that the South African variant is more adept at escaping immunity provided by previous infection or vaccination, raising concerns among researchers.

A third variant originating from Brazil, referred to as P.1, has also drawn considerable attention. Like the South African variant, P.1 carries mutations associated with potential immune resistance. Additionally, researchers have noted increased transmissibility of this variant, adding to the urgency of preventive measures.

Amidst the emergence of these variants, experts stress the importance of adhering to public health measures, such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and good hand hygiene. These measures remain effective against all strains of the virus and play a crucial role in preventing transmission.

In response to the threat posed by new variants, many countries have tightened travel restrictions, implementing stricter quarantine measures and requiring negative COVID-19 tests before entry. This approach aims to minimize the importation and spread of new variants across borders. However, experts caution that these measures alone may not be sufficient.

Vaccine manufacturers are closely monitoring the impact of variants on vaccine effectiveness. Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech have reported that their vaccines remain protective against the UK variant. However, studies are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy against other strains.

To address the concern of potential immune evasion, vaccine developers are also exploring strategies to modify existing vaccines or develop booster shots targeting specific variants. These efforts reflect the dedication and agility of scientists working towards ensuring continued protection against this evolving virus.

Amidst the fight against the virus and new variants, vaccination campaigns continue to be rolled out worldwide. Authorities emphasize prioritizing high-risk populations, such as healthcare workers and the elderly, in the distribution of vaccines. Vaccination remains a critical tool in curbing the spread of the virus and preventing severe illness and deaths.

The emergence of these variants is a sobering reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. As the virus continues to evolve, a combination of public health measures, surveillance, genomic sequencing, and vaccine adaptability will be crucial in overcoming these challenges. It is imperative that individuals remain vigilant and follow public health guidelines to protect themselves and others.",true
4976,Alaska AG thinks hitting plane’s call button saved his life.,"“This cannot be happening to me, I’m the guy who runs or walks three-five miles every day,” Clarkson recounted of the April 26 incident in guest column provided to media outlets this week. “Looked up at the call-button, hesitated — I thought ‘we’re only 30 minutes out of Seattle, maybe this will get better.’ But something inside my head said, ‘Stop fooling yourself.’ I reached up and hit the button, an act that likely saved my life,′ Clarkson wrote. Clarkson was flying from Louisiana to Seattle when the symptoms of the heart attack started. After he called for help, flight attendants identified a nurse on board the flight who took his blood pressure. “Her eyes got really wide when she saw the results,” Clarkson recalled. The nurse said paramedics would need to be standing by when the plane landed in Seattle. “The paramedics came on the plane while other passengers stayed seated — a big thanks to everyone for their patience — and I walked out to the gate with them. They performed an EKG, looked at it and said ‘yeah, you’re not going home tonight,’ and then called medics to transport me to the nearby hospital,” Clarkson wrote. He went into cardiac arrest just minutes later, with five medical professionals standing around him. “I remember looking up at them from my back on the floor and realizing what had happened. Those guys saved my life and I owe them my thanks,” Clarkson wrote. Clarkson said his heart attack was caused by a sudden blockage of blood flow in his right coronary artery that ruptured and turned into a full blockage. He was taken into surgery, where two stents were placed in his heart to keep the artery open. Before the surgery, Clarkson said the operating staff might have thought he was delusional, however. Every time they asked him how old he was, he replied with the question: “What time is it?” “I finally said, ‘Look, if it’s after midnight then I’m 60,’” he told them. “They wished me a happy birthday. What a party.” Clarkson said his experience has prompted him to urge others to live a healthier lifestyle, cut back on sugar, carbs and salt, and get checked by your doctor. He also said people need to know the signs of a heart attack that include pain in the chest, arm, discomfort radiating to the back, jaw, throat or arm, sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness. “If you experience these symptoms, don’t worry about making a fuss, let someone know or call for help. Better to experience a little embarrassment than to risk losing your life,” Clarkson wrote.","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a significant threat to public health worldwide, it is crucial for individuals to stay informed and follow recommended guidelines to mitigate the spread of the virus. Despite the progress made in combating the pandemic through vaccination efforts, the emergence of new variants demands attention and adaptation in our ongoing battle against the virus.

One such variant that has been causing concern among health experts is the Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2. This variant was first identified in India and has since spread to numerous countries around the globe. What sets the Delta variant apart from its predecessors is its increased transmissibility, which has resulted in surges of cases in various regions.

Studies have indicated that the Delta variant spreads approximately 60% more easily than the previously dominant Alpha variant, making it highly contagious. This heightened contagiousness has led to spikes in infection rates, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates or inadequate preventive measures. Experts warn that if left unchecked, the Delta variant could potentially lead to new waves of infections and overwhelm healthcare systems already strained by the pandemic.

To prevent the widespread transmission of the Delta variant, public health officials stress the importance of vaccination. Vaccines have proven effective in reducing severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by COVID-19, including its variants. However, data suggests that the Delta variant may slightly reduce vaccine efficacy; thus, obtaining full vaccination coverage across populations becomes even more critical.

Furthermore, experts emphasize the continued practice of preventive measures, such as mask-wearing, regular handwashing, and maintaining physical distance. These measures are vital in impeding viral transmission and protecting those who are not yet vaccinated, including children under the age of 12 who are currently ineligible for vaccination.

While the Delta variant poses a significant threat, it is not the only variant of concern. The Lambda variant, originating from Peru, has begun to spread in some regions. Although less prevalent than the Delta variant, Lambda possesses mutations that could potentially impact vaccine efficacy and transmissibility. Monitoring and surveillance efforts are crucial to track the emergence of new variants and assess their potential risks.

The rise of these variants highlights the need for ongoing genomic surveillance, robust testing capabilities, and a flexible response system. Identifying and tracking variants in real-time will allow for swift and targeted public health interventions, including updated vaccine strategies and booster shots if necessary. Global collaboration and data sharing also play essential roles in understanding and combating the evolving nature of the virus.

In conclusion, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, it is crucial for individuals and communities to remain vigilant and responsive to emerging variants. Getting vaccinated remains the most effective tool in reducing severe illness and hospitalizations caused by the Delta and other variants. Adherence to preventive measures, regardless of vaccination status, will help prevent the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable populations. Continued research, surveillance, and global cooperation will undoubtedly be vital in our ongoing fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and its ever-changing landscape of variants.",true
8867,Eli Lilly denies NYT report on Zyprexa.,"The report said John Lechleiter, set to become chief  executive in April, wrote an e-mail in 2003 discussing the use  of Zyprexa by children and teenagers, although it is only  approved for adults with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Eli Lily said the report was “flat out wrong” and it  mischaracterized Lechleiter’s e-mail. “Dr. Lechleiter’s email was nothing more than a call to  action to ensure Lilly’s development organization placed a high  priority on conducting clinical trials to address these  important medical questions,” it said in a statement. The report comes as Lilly faces lawsuits involving  marketing and side effects of the drug, including higher risk  of diabetes, weight gain and heart problems. The state of Connecticut sued the company on Tuesday,  accusing it of illegally marketing and concealing its serious  side effects. It faces similar accusations in Alaska. Zyprexa, by far Lilly’s biggest product, had sales of $4.76  billion in 2007, including U.S. sales of $2.24 billion. Lilly was accused in Connecticut of promoting the drug for  anxiety, depression and attention deficit disorder in children  despite its not receiving FDA approval for those uses. While doctors may prescribe medicines in any way they see  fit, companies are allowed to promote them only for uses  approved by U.S. health regulators.","The Case for Widespread COVID-19 Testing to Combat the Pandemic

With the ongoing battle against COVID-19, testing has emerged as a critical tool in identifying and combating the spread of the virus. As countries worldwide grapple with surges in cases and possible new variants, experts stress the urgent need for widespread testing to contain the pandemic effectively.

Testing serves two primary purposes in the fight against COVID-19. Firstly, it helps identify individuals who are infected, even if they show no symptoms. Asymptomatic carriers can unknowingly transmit the virus, making them potential super-spreaders. Regular testing enables the prompt identification of such cases, allowing for immediate isolation and preventing further transmission within communities.

Secondly, testing assists in contact tracing efforts. Once an individual tests positive, health authorities swiftly determine their close contacts. Testing these individuals ensures early detection of further infections, enabling officials to enact targeted measures, such as quarantine or additional testing, to limit the potential spread.

Early on in the pandemic, access to testing was limited due to various factors such as scarcity of resources, lack of infrastructure, and the prioritization of symptomatic cases. However, as testing capabilities have improved over time, so too has our understanding of the importance of widespread testing. It has become evident that relying solely on symptomatic testing leaves a significant portion of virus carriers unidentified and allows for undetected community transmission.

One effective strategy is implementing regular, frequent testing programs in places where the virus spreads easily, such as schools, workplaces, and high-risk settings like nursing homes. By regularly testing individuals in these environments, outbreaks can be detected early, preventing further spread and minimizing disruptions to education and business operations. In fact, numerous studies have demonstrated the utility of routine testing in mitigating the impact of the virus.

Moreover, widespread testing allows for more accurate epidemiological modeling, aiding in predicting case trajectories and providing valuable insights to public health officials and policymakers. It helps them evaluate the effectiveness of containment measures, adjust strategies accordingly, and make informed decisions about reopening economies or implementing stricter restrictions.

Critics argue that testing may not be fully reliable, pointing to false negatives and false positives. While no diagnostic test is perfect, advancements in testing technology have significantly improved accuracy rates. Despite limitations, widespread testing remains a crucial strategy in the absence of widespread vaccination.

Furthermore, rapid antigen testing has gained traction as an effective screening tool, providing quick results within minutes. Although they are slightly less sensitive than molecular tests like PCR, they are an affordable and accessible option in many locations. Frequent rapid antigen testing can compensate for any decreased sensitivity while still offering valuable information about virus transmission.

To implement widespread testing successfully, governments and health organizations need to address barriers hindering access, including financial costs, logistical challenges, and public reluctance. Collaboration between public and private sectors can help scale up testing capacities and ensure equitable distribution. Public education campaigns should emphasize the importance and benefits of testing to dispel fears and misinformation.

In conclusion, the case for widespread COVID-19 testing is clear. By identifying asymptomatic carriers, implementing routine testing programs, and utilizing rapid antigen tests, we can efficiently track and control the spread of the virus. Testing provides critical information for contact tracing, modeling disease trajectories, and making informed policy decisions. As we continue our fight against the pandemic, widespread testing is an essential tool that cannot be overlooked.",true
7735,French army to help in effort to stop swine fever at Belgian border.,"France has been on alert for African swine fever since the virus was confirmed in September among wild boar in neighboring Belgium. The disease, harmless for humans, is often deadly for pigs, and outbreaks in eastern Europe and China have disrupted the pork industry there. After the virus was found this month in wild boar in Belgium only about 1 km (less than a mile) from France, the French government announced plans to cull all wild boar in a high-risk zone by the border and put up tens of kilometers (miles) of fencing in a wider area to avert an outbreak of African swine fever. “To cull rapidly wild boar in the ‘white zone’ and halt African swine fever, general mobilization of hunters with the logistical support of the army,” Agriculture Minister Didier Guillaume said on his Twitter feed. The minister told France 2 television earlier that there were between 500 and 600 wild boar to be culled in the designated white zone and it would take two to three weeks. Army personnel would assist by laying traps or rounding up boar for hunters to shoot, a ministry spokesman said, adding that soldiers would not be firing. The boar-free zone spans 78 square km and will be enclosed by a 1.5 meter-high fence under construction on the French side, as well as fencing erected by Belgian authorities at the border, the French agriculture ministry has said. France plans to put up in total around 100 km (60 miles) of fencing around border areas in the northeast at a cost of several million euros, according to the ministry. African swine fever can be carried by wild boars but experts also stress that human factors such as transport, clothing and food waste can play a role in spreading the disease. No vaccination or treatment exist for the highly contagious virus. Last year’s outbreak among wild boar in Belgium marked a sudden westward spread of the virus in Europe, raising the risk it would reach large pork-production countries like Germany, France and Spain. Belgium has faced restrictions from importing countries on its pig meat exports, although African swine fever has yet to be detected on a pig farm.","COVID-19 Cases Surge in Major Cities: Urgent Action Needed

As the coronavirus pandemic continues to threaten communities across the globe, major cities are grappling with a surge in COVID-19 cases. The rapid increase has raised concerns among health officials and policymakers, calling for urgent action to curb the spread of the virus and prevent overwhelming healthcare systems.

Metropolises such as New York City, London, Paris, and Tokyo have witnessed a significant rise in infections in recent weeks. Experts attribute this resurgence to various factors, including the highly contagious Delta variant, increased social interactions, and vaccine hesitancy among certain populations.

In New York City, COVID-19 cases have soared by 150% over the past month, prompting local authorities to reimpose some restrictions and reinforce mask mandates. Health officials are urging residents, particularly those unvaccinated, to get the shots as soon as possible to protect themselves and others from severe illness and hospitalization.

Similarly, London is facing its highest COVID-19 infection rate since January, with over 1,000 new cases reported daily. Concerns are mounting about the strain on the healthcare system, as hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) brace for an influx of patients. To combat the surge, British leaders are considering vaccine passports for entry into crowded venues and encouraging young people to get vaccinated.

The situation is equally alarming in Paris, where COVID-19 cases have more than doubled in just two weeks. French authorities are now enforcing stricter measures, such as requiring proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter public places like restaurants and bars. Vaccination centers have been set up across the city to help expedite inoculations.

Japan, which is currently facing its fourth wave of infections, is witnessing a worrisome spike in cases, largely driven by the Delta variant. With the Olympics underway, officials are working tirelessly to mitigate the risk of further transmission. Although spectators are banned from most events, concerns remain about the potential for outbreaks among athletes and staff.

To combat the surge in major cities, health officials are advocating for a combination of strategies. First and foremost, they stress the importance of vaccination as the most effective tool in controlling the virus. Increasing vaccine accessibility and addressing vaccine hesitancy are key priorities.

Moreover, experts emphasize the need to reinforce public health measures such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and maintaining proper hand hygiene. These preventive measures, though simple, can significantly reduce the risk of transmission.

Additionally, policymakers should consider implementing targeted restrictions and guidelines based on the local epidemiological situation. By closely monitoring the data and adapting strategies accordingly, authorities can better respond to outbreaks and prevent further spread.

Lastly, community engagement and education play a vital role in combating the surge. Governments must provide clear and accurate information about COVID-19, vaccines, and safety protocols to dispel misinformation and build trust among the population.

As major cities grapple with surging COVID-19 cases, urgent action is crucial to protect communities and prevent additional strain on healthcare systems. By prioritizing vaccination, reinforcing preventive measures, adapting policies based on local needs, and fostering community engagement, we can collectively navigate through this challenging phase and move closer to a post-pandemic future.",true
7499,Straight-talking Fauci explains outbreak to a worried nation.,"The fear and confusion of outbreaks aren’t new to Fauci, who in more than 30 years has handled HIV, SARS, MERS, Ebola and even the nation’s 2001 experience with bioterrorism — the anthrax attacks. Fauci’s political bosses — from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump — have let him do the explaining because he’s frank and understandable, translating complex medical information into everyday language while neither exaggerating nor downplaying. If you quizzed former presidents about who influenced their views on infectious diseases, “Tony’s name would be first on the list, and you wouldn’t have to remind them,” said former health secretary Mike Leavitt, who worked with Fauci on bird flu preparedness. At 79, the government’s top infectious disease expert is by age in the demographic group at high risk for COVID-19. But he’s working round the clock and getting only a few hours of sleep. He’s a little hoarse from all the talking about coronavirus, and he’ll be on the TV news shows Sunday. Yet his vigor belies his age, and he credits it to exercise, including running. As of Thursday, he had not been tested for coronavirus. The National Institutes of Health, where he works, said that’s because he hasn’t needed to be. Fauci uses a metaphor from one of the fastest-moving sports to describe his strategy on the outbreak. “You skate not to where the puck is, but to where the puck is going to be,” he told a House committee. So he’s simultaneously advocating containment to try to keep the virus from spreading, mitigation to check its damage once it gets loose in a community, immediate efforts to increase testing, and short-term and long-term science to develop treatments and vaccines. He’s hoping a dynamic response will put the nation where the puck ends up going. “It’s unpredictable,” he said. “Testing now is not going to tell you how many cases you’re going to have. What will tell you ... will be how you respond to it with containment and mitigation.” Serving a president who until recently dismissed coronavirus by comparing it to seasonal flu, Fauci has been even-handed in public. He’s won the respect of Democratic and Republican lawmakers, along with Trump administration officials. Almost in matter-of-fact fashion Fauci acknowledged to Congress in recent days that the government system wasn’t designed for mass testing of potential infections. “It is a failing, let’s admit it,” he told lawmakers. But he also supported President Donald Trump’s restrictions on travel from Europe. It’s part of the containment strategy, he explained. “It was pretty compelling that we needed to turn off the source from that region,” he said. The threat of a pandemic has been on Fauci’s mind for years. Many scientists thought it would come from the flu, but it turned out to be coronavirus. Fauci was unflappable answering questions for hours from the House Oversight and Reform committee last week __ except if there was any hint of questioning his scientific integrity. “I served six presidents and I have never done anything other than tell the exact scientific evidence and made policy recommendations based on the science and the evidence,” he said. Democrats and Republicans have welcomed his approach. “The scientists I’ve spoken with in committee see you as the lead man, and I believe most of America does,” Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., told Fauci. Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts praised Fauci for accurately stating that a vaccine would not be available in a matter of months, contrary to what Trump has suggested at times. “You have a certain level of credibility and honesty that I think ... should be persuasive to the American people,” Lynch told him. Fauci’s candor hasn’t stopped Trump from praising him. “Tony has been doing a tremendous job working long, long hours,” the president said Friday at a Rose Garden event. Anthony Stephen Fauci was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Christmas Eve, 1940, into an Italian-American family. President George W. Bush, who in 2008 awarded Fauci the Presidential Medal of Freedom, noted that even as a boy he showed an independent streak: In a neighborhood full of Brooklyn Dodgers fans, Fauci rooted for the Yankees. Fauci became head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 1984, when the nation was in the throes of the AIDS crisis. He’s recalled the huge frustration of caring for dying patients in the NIH’s hospital with nothing to offer. After hours, he’d chat with then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop about what scientists were learning about AIDS, influencing Koop’s famous 1986 report educating Americans about the disease. In 1990, when AIDS activists swarmed the NIH to protest what they saw as government indifference, Fauci brought them to the table. Fast forward, and he helped to shape Trump’s initiative to end HIV in the U.S. Although he’s spent his career in government, Fauci doesn’t seem to have lost the human touch — and that may be part of the key to his success as a communicator. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, many Americans panicked when a U.S. nurse got infected by a patient she was caring for, a traveler from West Africa. Ebola can cause deadly bleeding. Fauci confronted those fears by setting a personal example. When the NIH hospital released that nurse, not only did he say she wasn’t contagious, he gave her a hug before TV cameras to prove he was not worried.","France Imposes New COVID-19 Restrictions Amid Surge in Cases 

France, like many countries around the world, is grappling with a surge in COVID-19 cases as the highly transmissible Delta variant spreads rapidly. In response to this alarming situation, the French government has announced new measures and restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the virus and protecting public health.

One of the major steps taken by the French authorities is the implementation of a health pass system. Starting in August, individuals aged 12 and above will be required to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result in order to gain entry to various public venues, including restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, hospitals, and long-distance transportation services. This move aims to encourage more people to get vaccinated and reduce the risk of infection in crowded indoor spaces.

Furthermore, President Emmanuel Macron announced that vaccination would be mandatory for all healthcare workers and reiterated his call for every citizen in France to get immunized against COVID-19. The government has also made efforts to streamline the vaccination process by setting up pop-up vaccination centers in numerous locations, making it easier for people to access vaccines.

In addition to the health pass requirement, France has tightened its borders, implementing stricter rules for travelers from some countries where the Delta variant is prevalent. Unvaccinated individuals coming from these high-risk areas will not be allowed entry into the country without a compelling reason, and those who are permitted entry may face mandatory quarantine periods.

Recognizing the impact of COVID-19 on the education sector, the French government has also mandated vaccination for all teachers and has made it compulsory for students aged 12 and above to wear masks in school. These measures aim to protect children and adults alike, ensuring the safe continuation of education while mitigating the risk of virus transmission.

While these measures have sparked protests from a minority who oppose vaccination and the associated restrictions, they have been widely supported by healthcare professionals and majority of the public. Many people believe that these interventions are essential to prevent an overwhelming surge in cases and a potential strain on already burdened healthcare systems.

The Delta variant, which is believed to be twice as transmissible as previous variants, has led to a steady rise in COVID-19 infections in France. Hospitalizations have also increased, primarily among unvaccinated individuals. This concerning trend has prompted the French government to act swiftly to protect the population and prevent further loss of life.

It is important to note that the new restrictions and measures are temporary and will be re-evaluated periodically based on the evolving situation. The French government aims to strike a balance between safeguarding public health and enabling a return to normalcy as soon as possible.

In conclusion, France's recent implementation of a health pass system, mandatory vaccinations for certain groups, and stricter border controls demonstrates the seriousness with which they are addressing the surge in COVID-19 cases fueled by the highly contagious Delta variant. These measures are crucial to protect public health, reduce hospitalizations, and ultimately save lives. As the situation continues to evolve, it is vital for everyone to remain vigilant and follow public health guidelines to overcome this challenging period.",true
2964,France's Carmat implants its first artificial heart in human.,"The implant operation was performed on Wednesday at the Georges Pompidou European Hospital in Paris, the biomedical firm said in a statement. It said that the male patient was awake and talking and he was being monitored in the intensive care unit. “We are delighted with this first implant, although it is premature to draw conclusions given that a single implant has been performed and that we are in the early postoperative phase”, said Carmat’s CEO, Marcello Conviti. Heart-assistance devices have been used for decades as a temporary solution for patients awaiting transplants, but Carmat’s bioprosthetic product is designed to replace the real heart over the long run, mimicking nature’s work using biological materials and sensors. It is aimed at helping the thousands of patients who die each year while awaiting a donor, and reducing the side-effects associated with transplants. “It’s about giving patients a normal social life with the least dependence on medication as possible,” Alain Carpentier, surgeon and Carmat co-founder, told France 2 television. Carmat estimates around 100,000 patients in the United States and Europe could benefit from its artificial heart, a market worth more than 16 billion euros ($22 billion). “We already had devices of this type but they had a relatively low autonomy. This heart will allow for more movement and less clotting. The study that is starting is being very closely watched in the medical field,” Patrick Nataf, head of heart surgery at Paris Bichat hospital, told BFM TV. France’s Health Minister was quick to tout the operation as a sign of the country’s edge in the field of healthcare. “This news brings great pride to France,” Marisol Touraine told BFM TV. “It shows we are pioneers in healthcare, that we can invent, that we can carry an innovation that will also bring great hope to plenty of people.”  Among Carmat’s competitors for artificial heart implants are privately-held SynCardia Systems and Abiomed, both of the United States. “We’re very happy for them and we wish them the best in their pursuit,” said a spokesman for SynCardia, whose artificial heart is the only one approved both in the United States and the European Union and has been implanted over 1,200 times. The longest a patient has lived with SynCardia’s heart is just under four years. In September, Carmat got the green light from French authorities to test the first human implants of the device on four patients in three hospitals. Earlier this year, it won approval to proceed with human implants in Belgium, Poland, Slovenia and Saudi Arabia. The Paris patient is the first worldwide to be implanted with the device, Carmat said. The patients selected for the trials suffer from terminal heart failure and the success of the device will be judged on whether they survive with the implant for at least a month. Conviti told Reuters last month Carmat hoped to finish human trials of the heart by the end of next year and to obtain approval to market them in the EU by early 2015. The Carmat device, developed by a team of engineers from Airbus parent company EADS, weighs about 900g (around 2 lb)- nearly three times more than an average healthy human heart. It is expected to cost 140,000 to 180,000 euros in Europe. It mimics heart muscle contractions and contains sensors that adapt the blood flow to the patient’s moves. It is powered by external, wearable lithium-ion batteries. Inside the heart, surfaces that come into contact with human blood are made partly from bovine tissue instead of synthetic materials such as plastic that can cause blood clots. Patients that will be implanted with Carmat’s devices are more likely to be men. Heart failure affects more men than women and the sheer size of the artificial heart means it can fit in 86 percent of men but only around 20 percent of women. But Carmat says it could easily manufacture a smaller version to fit the smaller bodies of women as well as patients in India and China. Carmat’s shares have risen five-fold since floating on the Paris stock market in 2010, giving the company a market capitalization of about 436 million euros. ($1 = 0.7315 euros)","Experts Warn of Possible Fourth Wave of COVID-19 as Cases Surge

As the world continues to battle with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, experts are issuing warnings about a potential fourth wave of infections. With the recent surge in cases, especially in countries that had previously seen declining numbers, concerns about new variants and vaccine efficacy have come to the forefront.

Throughout the past year, we have witnessed the devastating impact of COVID-19 on lives and livelihoods. Many countries implemented strict measures such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, and mass vaccination campaigns to curb the spread of the virus. These efforts resulted in promising declines in case numbers and hospitalizations, bringing a glimpse of hope in a dark time.

However, amidst continued global vaccination efforts, complacency has begun to set in. People have grown tired of adhering to safety protocols, and pandemic fatigue is widespread. This complacency, combined with the emergence of new variants, has led to a significant resurgence in cases in several areas around the world.

In countries like India, Brazil, and parts of Europe, steep increases in infection rates have prompted fears of a potential fourth wave. Experts attribute this surge to new virus variants, particularly the highly transmissible Delta variant. The Delta variant, which was first identified in India, has rapidly spread across multiple countries, including the United States.

The concerning nature of this variant lies not only in its ability to spread quickly but also its potential resistance to some vaccines. Preliminary studies suggest that while current vaccinations provide protection against severe illness and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant, they may be less effective at preventing milder cases or asymptomatic infections. This finding raises concerns about the effectiveness of existing vaccination campaigns and the need for additional measures to control the spread of the virus.

To counter the rising tide of infections, health officials are urging cautiousness and adherence to preventive measures. Driven by an urgency to vaccinate as many people as possible, countries have ramped up their vaccination efforts. This includes administering booster shots, expanding eligibility criteria, and increasing vaccine availability in underserved areas.

Nevertheless, experts caution that widespread vaccination alone is not enough to prevent a fourth wave. They emphasize the importance of maintaining public health measures such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings, particularly in areas experiencing surges in cases or where new variants have been identified.

While the situation remains fluid and varies by country, it is crucial for governments and individuals to remain vigilant. Monitoring emerging variants and swiftly adapting vaccination strategies will play a key role in mitigating the potential impact of a fourth wave.

As the world copes with yet another surge in COVID-19 cases, it is evident that the battle against this virus is far from over. It is imperative for individuals to prioritize both personal and collective responsibility in adhering to safety guidelines. As we navigate through these challenging times together, staying informed, getting vaccinated, and taking necessary precautions can help stem the tide and protect ourselves and our communities from further devastation.",true
8563,Speed of coronavirus deaths shock doctors as New York toll hits new high.,"The number of known coronavirus infections in New York state alone approached 150,000 on Wednesday, even as authorities warned that the official death tally may understate the true number because it omits those who have perished at home. “Every number is a face, “ said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who ordered flags flown at half-staff across New York in memory of the victims. “This virus attacked the vulnerable and attacked the weak, and it’s our job as a society to protect the vulnerable.”  Doctors and nurses say elderly patients and those with underlying health conditions are not the only ones who appear relatively well one moment and at death’s door the next. It happens to the young and healthy, too. Patients “look fine, feel fine, then you turn around and they’re unresponsive,” said Diana Torres, a nurse at Mount  Sinai Hospital in New York City, the center of the nation’s worst outbreak. “I’m paranoid, scared to walk out of their room.”  Nearly 430,000 cases of COVID-19, the highly infectious lung disease caused by the coronavirus, were confirmed in the United States as of Wednesday afternoon, including more than 14,700 deaths. For the second straight day the virus killed at least 1,900 in a 24-hour period. Cuomo said 779 people had died in the past day in his state. New Jersey reported 275 had died there. Both totals exceeded one-day records from just a day earlier. Despite the grim figures, Cuomo said overall trends still appeared positive. Cuomo cited a drop in new hospitalizations and other data as evidence that New York’s social-distancing restrictions were “bending the curve,” helping to gain some control over the infection rate. New York is one of 42 states where governors have issued “stay-at-home” orders and closed all non-essential workplaces. While public health experts say such measures are vital for controlling the contagion, the restrictions have strangled the U.S. economy, leading to widespread layoffs, upheavals on Wall Street and projections of a severe recession. Cuomo said the loss of life would likely continue at current levels or increase in days ahead as critically ill patients die after prolonged bouts hooked up to ventilators. U.S. deaths due to coronavirus topped 14,700 on Wednesday, the second highest reported number in the world behind Italy, according to a Reuters tally. New York state accounts for over a third of the U.S. total. Officials have warned Americans to expect alarming numbers of coronavirus deaths this week, even as an influential university model on Wednesday scaled back its projected U.S. pandemic death toll by 26% to 60,000. “We are in the midst of a week of heartache,” Vice President Mike Pence said during a White House briefing on Wednesday, but added, “we are beginning to see glimmers of hope.”  Dr. Craig Smith, surgeon-in-chief at Presbyterian Hospital’s Columbia University Medical Center in Manhattan, heralded encouraging numbers that suggested a turning tide in Wednesday’s edition of his daily newsletter to staff. There were more discharges of patients than admissions for two days running, he said, adding: “Hosanna!”  But that comes as cold comfort to some healthcare workers on the front lines, who told Reuters they have treated patients while experiencing symptoms of the novel coronavirus themselves without being able to get tested. In Michigan, one of the few hospital systems conducting widespread diagnostic screenings of staff, found more than 700 workers were infected - over a quarter of those tested. The continued test kit shortages - even for the workers most at risk - is “scandalous” and a serious threat to the patients they treat, said Dr. Art Caplan, a professor of bioethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. At the White House on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would like to reopen the U.S. economy with a “big bang” but not before the death toll is on the downslope. Trump did not offer a time frame, but his chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said on Tuesday a resumption of commerce was possible in four to eight weeks. Louisiana is “beginning to see the flattening of the curve” with the number of new coronavirus cases reported in the past 24 hours - 746 - lower than recent days, Governor John Bel Edwards  said. Louisiana had been one of the nation’s hot spots. California, like New York, had one of its highest single-day death tolls with 68 people dying of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, Governor Gavin Newsom said. The state may not see its infection curve flattening until the end of May, requiring weeks more of social distancing, officials say. New York City officials said a recent surge in people dying at home suggests the most populous U.S. city may be undercounting the loss of life. “I think that’s a very real possibility,” Cuomo told his daily news briefing. So far New York City’s announced death toll has reflected only laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, mostly at hospitals. At least 200 people are believed to be dying at home in the city every day during the pandemic, authorities said. Pence warned that Philadelphia and Pittsburgh were cities of “particular concern” as a possible future flash points in the epidemic.","New Variant of COVID-19 Detected in South Africa

A new variant of the coronavirus has been detected in South Africa, raising concerns among health officials worldwide. The variant, known as B.1.351, is characterized by a higher transmission rate and potential resistance to current vaccines. While there is no evidence to suggest that it causes more severe illness, experts are urging for increased vigilance and adherence to safety measures.

The discovery of this variant comes at a time when countries around the world are grappling with rising cases and struggling to contain the spread of the virus. Scientists have been closely monitoring the evolving nature of the virus since its emergence in late 2019, and multiple variants have been detected across different regions.

B.1.351, also referred to as the South African variant, was first identified in Nelson Mandela Bay in October 2020. Since then, it has rapidly spread within the country and has been detected in other parts of the world, including the United States, United Kingdom, and other African nations. Preliminary studies suggest that this variant may be up to 50% more transmissible than earlier strains of the virus.

One of the major concerns surrounding this variant is its potential impact on vaccine effectiveness. While the existing vaccines have shown promising results against the original strain, preliminary data indicates that they may be less effective in preventing infection from the B.1.351 variant. However, additional research is required to fully understand the extent of this potential limitation.

In response to the emergence of this variant, several countries have implemented stricter travel restrictions and quarantine measures for those arriving from South Africa. This is part of an effort to prevent the importation and further spread of the new variant within their territories. However, experts warn that travel restrictions alone are not sufficient, and a comprehensive approach including testing, contact tracing, and adherence to safety protocols are crucial in curbing the transmission of the virus.

Health authorities emphasize that the fundamentals of infection prevention - wearing masks, practicing good hand hygiene, maintaining physical distancing, and avoiding large gatherings - remain vital in reducing the risk of exposure to this new variant. These measures have proven effective against the earlier strains and are expected to be equally important in mitigating the spread of B.1.351.

Additionally, researchers and pharmaceutical companies are already working on modifying existing vaccines and developing new ones that can target the specific mutations present in this variant. This ongoing scientific effort underscores the importance of continued investment in research and development to address the evolving nature of the virus.

While the emergence of new variants raises concerns, it is important to note that these findings are not unexpected. Viruses naturally mutate over time, and many variants go unnoticed or don't significantly alter the behavior of the virus. The World Health Organization and other global health bodies will continue to monitor the situation closely, collaborating with scientists and governments to ensure timely information sharing and response coordination.

In conclusion, the detection of the B.1.351 variant in South Africa has further highlighted the need for global vigilance and adherence to public health measures. Efforts to control the pandemic must be intensified, with a focus on vaccination campaigns, testing, contact tracing, and maintaining personal protective behaviors. Despite the challenges posed by this new variant, the scientific community remains committed to evolving strategies that protect public health and limit the impact of COVID-19.",true
8583,CDC removes unusual guidance to doctors about drug favored by Trump.,"The move comes three days after Reuters reported that the CDC published key dosing information involving the two antimalarial drugs based on unattributed anecdotes rather than peer-reviewed science. Reuters also reported that the original guidance was crafted by the CDC after President Trump personally pressed federal regulatory and health officials to make the malaria drugs more widely available to treat the novel coronavirus, though the drugs in question had been untested for COVID-19. Initially, the CDC webpage, titled Information for Clinicians on Therapeutic Options for Patients with COVID-19, had said: “Although optimal dosing and duration of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 are unknown, some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotally” on several ways to prescribe the medication of COVID-19. Medical specialists had told Reuters they were surprised by that language. “Why would CDC be publishing anecdotes?” asked Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University. “That doesn’t make sense. This is very unusual.”  Doctors and other health experts had further criticized the guidance as suggesting that doctors might prescribe the medications when it isn’t established whether or not they are effective or harmful. Now the CDC website no longer includes that information. Instead, its first sentence says: “There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19.”  The updated, and shortened, guidance adds that “Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are under investigation in clinical trials” for use on coronavirus patients. To read the new CDC guidance, click here  The CDC did not immediately respond to questions about the removal of the original guidance. In a statement, it had originally told Reuters it had crafted the guidance for doctors at the request of a coronavirus task force, which urged prompt action. Jeffrey Flier, a former dean of Harvard Medical School who had criticized the original guidance, applauded the updated version, calling it “substantially improved.”  “It states the facts without in effect recommending that physicians prescribe the drugs despite a lack of adequate evidence,” Flier said. The hydroxychloroquine debate has heated up and become more political as President Trump this weekend said he might want to take the drug himself.","COVID-19 Vaccines Proven Safe and Effective: A Game Changer in the Fight against the Pandemic

The global battle against the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant turn with the development and distribution of several effective vaccines. These vaccines have proven to be a game changer in the fight against the deadly virus, offering hope for a return to normalcy.

Vaccine Development and Clinical Trials

Since the early days of the pandemic, scientists and researchers across the world have been working tirelessly to develop safe and effective vaccines. Several pharmaceutical companies and research institutions collaborated with unprecedented speed and efficiency to accelerate the development process.

Extensive clinical trials were conducted to ensure the safety and efficacy of these vaccines. Tens of thousands of volunteers participated in these trials, representative of diverse age groups, ethnicities, and health backgrounds. The rigorous testing process included monitoring for adverse effects and analyzing the vaccine's ability to trigger an immune response against the virus.

Safety and Efficacy Results

The results from multiple clinical trials have been overwhelmingly positive. The vaccines demonstrated high efficacy rates, ranging from 70% to over 95%, depending on the manufacturer. These rates far surpass the minimum effectiveness required by regulatory bodies.

Furthermore, extensive safety data has been collected throughout the clinical trials. Adverse effects were found to be minimal, with the majority being mild and transient, such as soreness at the injection site or flu-like symptoms. Severe adverse reactions were rare and comparable to those associated with other commonly used vaccines.

Emergency Use Authorization and Global Distribution

As a testament to their safety and efficacy, multiple countries granted emergency use authorization to various COVID-19 vaccines, allowing for their immediate deployment. Governments and healthcare authorities are now swiftly administering vaccinations to prioritize vulnerable populations, including healthcare workers, the elderly, and individuals with underlying health conditions.

Global distribution efforts have been underway with the help of international collaborations and initiatives such as COVAX. While there have been initial challenges in vaccine availability and equitable allocation, efforts are being made to ensure fair distribution worldwide.

Benefits of Vaccination

The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination are vast. Firstly, the vaccines significantly reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death caused by the virus. Even if individuals were to contract the virus after vaccination, their symptoms are generally milder and less detrimental.

Secondly, widespread vaccination holds the promise of achieving herd immunity. This occurs when a significant portion of the population becomes immune either through vaccination or previous infection. Herd immunity will help protect those who cannot be vaccinated, such as infants or individuals with compromised immune systems.

Lastly, the successful deployment of COVID-19 vaccines brings optimism for the eventual easing of restrictive measures and a return to normalcy. As vaccination rates increase, countries can gradually lift lockdowns, reopen businesses, and revive tourism and travel industries.

Conclusion

The development and distribution of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines symbolize a turning point in the global fight against the pandemic. With high efficacy rates and minimal side effects, these vaccines provide immense hope for a brighter future. However, it is crucial to continue following public health guidelines, such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing, until herd immunity is achieved. The road ahead may still present challenges, but the progress made thus far is certainly worth celebrating.",true
8261,'False fears' about vaping stopping smokers using e-cigs: UK report.,"In a report commissioned by the health agency Public Health England (PHE), scientists at King’s College London said the mistaken belief that e-cigarettes are more harmful than smoking had gained ground rapidly following thousands of reported cases of lung injury in the United States in late 2019. But the belief is “out of line” with expert reviews from Britain and the United States concluding that using regulated nicotine vapes is far less harmful than smoking, they said. The report, the sixth by PHE on this issue, is likely to deepen divisions in opinion about the potential risks of e-cigarettes. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last month it had recorded more than 2,800 cases of lung injury linked to vaping. “It is concerning to see how much the U.S. lung disease outbreak has affected smokers’ views on e-cigarettes here in the UK,” said John Newton, director of health improvement at PHE. “Safety fears may well be deterring many smokers from switching, leaving them on a path to years of ill health and an early death due to their smoking,” he said. PHE says smoking causes 220 premature deaths a day in England alone. Health authorities in the United States have said that vitamin E acetate, a thickening agent added to cannabis vapes, is the likely primary cause of the U.S. outbreak. The substance is banned from UK-regulated nicotine vapes and e-cigarettes. John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco & Alcohol Studies, said the PHE report’s findings were “disturbing”. “Smoking remains the biggest avoidable cause of death and disability in the UK, and using electronic cigarettes is an effective means of quitting smoking,” he said. He called for campaigns to ensure that “all smokers understand that switching to e-cigarettes is one of the most effective ways of quitting smoking and protecting their health”. The report reiterated PHE’s view that “e-cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco but are not completely safe”. They contain far fewer of the harmful chemicals which cause smoking-related diseases, it said, “but the long-term impact of using e-cigarettes will remain unknown for some time”. The U.S. government has proposed a sweeping ban on all vaping flavours that are seen as attracting young users. The PHE cautioned against any similar move in Britain, saying it would deter smokers from switching and would “ultimately cost lives”.","The current surge in COVID-19 cases highlights the urgent need for increased vaccination efforts and continued adherence to preventive measures. As new variants continue to emerge, it is crucial that we stay vigilant and prioritize public health above all else.

In recent weeks, countries around the world have witnessed a significant rise in COVID-19 infections. Many experts attribute this surge to the Delta variant, known for its increased transmissibility. This highly contagious strain has rapidly spread across borders, leading to widespread concerns among public health officials.

Despite making significant progress with vaccination campaigns earlier this year, there is still a large portion of the population that remains unvaccinated. This has contributed to the current wave of infections, as individuals who are not vaccinated are more susceptible to severe illness and hospitalization. In countries with high vaccination rates, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, the overwhelming majority of new cases and hospitalizations are among the unvaccinated population.

To combat the spread of COVID-19 and its variants, governments and health authorities are ramping up their vaccination efforts. Many countries are implementing aggressive vaccination campaigns, targeting specific populations and offering incentives to encourage greater vaccination uptake. Vaccine distribution centers have been expanded, and walk-in appointments are being made available to make it easier for people to get their shots.

Furthermore, health officials continue to emphasize the importance of preventive measures, regardless of vaccination status. Wearing masks, practicing good hand hygiene, and maintaining social distancing are critical in reducing the spread of the virus. While vaccines provide significant protection, they are not foolproof, especially against new variants. By combining vaccination with these preventive measures, we can better control the transmission and prevent further surges.

One major concern is the impact of the Delta variant on children and adolescents. Previously, children were considered less susceptible to severe illness; however, recent data suggests that the Delta variant poses a greater risk to this age group. With schools reopening soon in many parts of the world, ensuring comprehensive safety protocols and increasing vaccination rates among teenagers becomes imperative to protect both students and the wider community.

Another challenge that global health authorities are facing is vaccine hesitancy. Despite extensive research and large-scale clinical trials demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of approved vaccines, misinformation and skepticism continue to affect vaccination rates. This obstacle must be actively addressed through targeted communication campaigns, community engagement, and education to counteract vaccine hesitancy and ensure accurate information reaches the public.

The fight against COVID-19 is far from over. As we navigate this latest surge in cases, it is crucial for governments, health authorities, and individuals to unite in their efforts to curb the spread of the virus. Increasing vaccination rates, reinforcing preventive measures, and combatting vaccine hesitancy will be pivotal in overcoming the challenges posed by this persistent pandemic.

In conclusion, the current wave of COVID-19 cases, driven by the Delta variant, underlines the need for accelerated vaccination campaigns and continued adherence to preventive measures. The race to vaccinate the population and prevent further surges remains a top priority for governments and health authorities worldwide. By working together and remaining vigilant, we can overcome this latest challenge and move closer to ending the pandemic once and for all.",true
3945,North Carolina health system restricts visitation due to flu.,"In a statement posted on its webpage on Tuesday, Vidant Health says that beginning Thursday, its hospitals will accept visitors 12 years of age and older and those who aren’t exhibiting symptoms of a cold or flu., diarrhea, vomiting or headaches. The health system says healthy children under the age of 12 may visit their healthy newborn sibling. Additional exceptions will be made in special circumstances—or with prior approval from the patient’s health care team. Vidant notes that the limitations are temporary and will be lifted when the flu cases in the community decrease. Vidant Health has nine hospitals serving 29 counties in eastern North Carolina.","Over the past year, COVID-19 has disrupted lives and economies around the world. As countries strive to control the spread of the virus through vaccinations and public health measures, a new challenge has emerged: the rise of COVID-19 variants. These variants present an additional threat, as some are more transmissible and potentially more resistant to existing treatments and vaccines.

One such variant that has been causing concern among public health officials is the Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2. This variant was first identified in India and has since spread to many countries, including the United States. Initial studies have shown that the Delta variant is significantly more contagious than previous strains of the coronavirus.

Experts warn that this increased transmissibility could lead to a surge in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths if left unchecked. Recent data shows that areas with low vaccination rates are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks fueled by the Delta variant. In fact, the United States is currently seeing an increase in COVID-19 cases, predominantly driven by this variant.

Public health officials emphasize the urgency of getting vaccinated as the best defense against the Delta variant. Multiple studies have demonstrated that authorized vaccines provide strong protection against severe illness and hospitalization caused by this variant. However, it is important to note that certain individuals, such as those with compromised immune systems, may have reduced vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, achieving high vaccination rates across all populations remains critical to controlling the spread of the Delta variant.

In response to the Delta variant threat, some countries and regions have implemented stricter measures to curb transmission. These include reimposing mask mandates, scaling up testing efforts, and enforcing targeted lockdowns in areas experiencing surges. By using these strategies along with speeding up vaccination campaigns, authorities aim to minimize the impact of the variant on public health and prevent overwhelming healthcare systems.

Addressing concerns over the Delta variant's potential resistance to vaccines, pharmaceutical companies and research institutions are closely monitoring its behavior. Preliminary studies suggest that the authorized vaccines remain effective against preventing severe disease and hospitalization, even with the Delta variant. However, ongoing research is needed to fully understand the long-term implications of this variant and its potential impact on future vaccine effectiveness.

To stay ahead of the evolving threat posed by COVID-19 variants, experts stress the importance of continued surveillance and genomic sequencing. By actively identifying and monitoring new variants, scientists can adapt vaccines and public health strategies to provide optimal protection moving forward.

In conclusion, the rise of the Delta variant serves as a reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. This highly transmissible variant poses a significant challenge in controlling the spread of the virus and maintaining public health. Vaccination remains our best defense against the variant, along with adhering to public health guidelines such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing. It is crucial that individuals continue to stay informed and follow the guidance of health officials to protect themselves and their communities from the impact of the Delta variant.",true
3918,Inspectors wanted: New Mexico sets sights on public health.,"Environment Secretary James Kenney says the state Legislature needs to make a bigger investment to bolster the tools his agency has so it can meet its regulatory responsibilities. “We have a direct correlation to public health and I think people don’t often remember that is in the forefront of our mission — protecting public health and the environment,” Kenney told The Associated Press this week. Kenney is asking for an additional $8.8 million in state general funds and for flexibility to increase fees that would bring in more revenue from the permitting and other services the state environment department already provides. The money would help pay for nearly 70 more employees and help the agency fill dozens of existing vacancies. The request will be among many when the Legislature meets in January for a 30-day session to determine spending priorities. Another surplus is expected because of the continued record revenues coming from oil and gas drilling, but some lawmakers have warned that spending should be kept in check in case of a future downturn. The environment department’s request has the support of first-year Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who has spoken about curbing emissions from the oil and gas sector and creating new industries to offset reliance on drilling. One of those burgeoning industries is hemp manufacturing. The environment department is establishing the permitting and inspection infrastructure needed for the industry. Without legislative appropriations, Kenney said his agency has been forced to move inspectors from the food program to work on hemp and that has cost the state about $60,000 in federal grant money. “That’s happening time and time again to the point where we are not — I will say it — we are not sufficiently implementing our mission in a way that I think this department could and should,” he said. There are more than 9,200 food preparation and manufacturing spots that the environment department is responsible for inspecting. The current budget includes 22 full-time positions for the task. That caseload has resulted in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration chiding the state for not having the capacity for follow-up inspections at problem sites. “That’s largely a staffing and budgetary issue,” Kenney said. “We don’t have the luxury of going back to these places to confirm that they made the recommendations to bring them into compliance.” The workload is just as high for inspectors overseeing drinking water sources, hazardous wastes, workplace safety, petroleum storage tanks and medical equipment, according to figures from the environment department. When it comes to air emissions, the state has five inspectors to monitor 7,700 sources. Despite the personnel shortage, the agency has turned to technology for help. Thousands of air inspections recently were done across New Mexico’s portion of the Permian Basin using a helicopter and an infrared camera that can spot methane emissions. “There comes a point where our staffing needs to rely on technology because the universe is so large,” Kenney said. “We have to think that way. We don’t have the luxury to not think that way.”","COVID-19 Vaccination Rate Drops: Urgent Action Needed

As the world battles the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, one crucial tool in our arsenal is vaccination. However, recent data reveals a worrisome trend as vaccination rates have seen a sharp decline in many countries. This alarming development calls for immediate action from governments and health officials to address vaccine hesitancy and ensure widespread immunization to safeguard public health.

Across the globe, vaccination efforts had witnessed significant progress earlier this year, with millions of people receiving their doses. Governments launched ambitious campaigns to encourage citizens to get vaccinated, highlighting the importance of achieving herd immunity and putting an end to the pandemic. Yet, despite these efforts, vaccination numbers have plummeted over the past few months.

One primary driver for the drop in vaccination rates is vaccine hesitancy. Skepticism, fear, and misinformation regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines continue to breed doubt among certain sections of the population. Conspiracy theories and false narratives find fertile ground online, making it challenging for accurate information to reach those who need it most. Health authorities must urgently counter misinformation by doubling down on efforts to educate the public about the benefits and science behind vaccines.

In addition to vaccine hesitancy, logistical challenges and inequalities have hindered immunization rates. In some regions, limited access to vaccines has become a real roadblock to achieving high vaccination coverage. Developing nations, struggling with a scarcity of vaccines and inadequate healthcare infrastructure, find themselves grappling with an uphill battle in reaching their populations. Wealthier countries must step up and fulfill their commitments to distribute vaccines more equitably, ensuring that every corner of the world has fair access to this life-saving resource.

Moreover, complacency seems to have set in among segments of the population where COVID-19 cases have subsided or lockdown measures have been lifted. With restrictions easing and daily life returning to a semblance of normalcy, some individuals may overlook the importance of getting vaccinated. Health officials must employ targeted messaging campaigns to remind the public that vaccination remains a crucial step in safeguarding against COVID-19 and its potential future variants.

The consequences of low vaccination rates are already becoming evident. Some countries are experiencing a resurgence of cases, primarily driven by pockets of unvaccinated individuals. These localized outbreaks pose a threat not only to those who remain unprotected but also to global efforts in curbing the spread of the virus. The emergence of more contagious variants further underscores the need for prompt and widespread immunization.

To reverse the declining trend and ensure adequate vaccine uptake, governments must implement proactive measures. Public health agencies should collaborate with community leaders, healthcare professionals, and trusted influencers to dispel myths and misinformation surrounding vaccines. Efforts should focus on reaching vulnerable populations and addressing their concerns through transparent communication strategies.

Furthermore, vaccination centers need to be more accessible and flexible, accommodating various schedules and populations. Mobile vaccine clinics and extended operating hours can help remove logistical barriers and enhance convenience, particularly for individuals juggling work and family responsibilities.

In conclusion, the drop in COVID-19 vaccination rates poses a significant challenge to our fight against the pandemic. Urgent action is required to counter vaccine hesitancy, address inequality in vaccine distribution, and combat complacency. Governments, health authorities, and communities must unite to prioritize education, accessibility, and equitable distribution to successfully navigate these challenging times. By doing so, we have the best chance to protect lives, prevent future surges, and ultimately bring an end to this devastating global crisis.",true

Because scaling up our domestic production will take time,” said a top Indian policy official aware of the plan, who declined to be identified due to sensitivity of the discussions. The Netherlands has recalled thousands of masks imported from China because of quality issues, while Spain has complained about defective imported test kits supplied by a Chinese manufacturer, media have reported. China’s foreign ministry said several countries had raised doubts about the quality of products imported from China, and acknowledged that there might be some problems. """"A large number of Chinese manufacturers are working around the clock to help other countries save lives. Our sincerity and assistance is real.

As the world battles the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has reached a significant milestone in its vaccination efforts. More than half of American adults are now fully vaccinated against the virus, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The achievement comes as a result of months of dedicated efforts by healthcare professionals, government agencies, and local communities to make vaccines available and encourage their uptake. With over 165 million Americans now fully vaccinated, there is hope that the country is gaining ground in the fight against COVID-19.

Experts have consistently stressed the importance of vaccination as an effective tool to control and ultimately overcome the pandemic. Vaccines have been rigorously tested and proven to be safe and effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by the virus. Achieving a vaccination rate of over 50% among American adults signifies a major step forward in curbing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting vulnerable populations.

In recent weeks, the pace of vaccinations has accelerated across the country, thanks to various initiatives aimed at making vaccines accessible to all. Mobile vaccination clinics, pop-up sites in underserved communities, and expanded distribution networks have played a crucial role in reaching those who were initially hesitant or faced logistical barriers to getting vaccinated.

Additionally, public awareness campaigns highlighting the benefits of vaccination and addressing common concerns have also contributed to increased vaccine acceptability. Health authorities have worked tirelessly to combat misinformation and provide accurate information about the vaccines' safety and efficacy.

Despite the progress made, it is essential to acknowledge that challenges still lie ahead. Vaccination rates across states and regions vary, with some areas experiencing lower uptake than others. To achieve herd immunity and effectively suppress the virus, efforts must continue to ensure that vaccines are accessible to all communities, particularly those disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

To sustain the momentum, health officials are now focusing their attention on vaccinating adolescents aged 12 to 17. Following the recent authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for this age group, millions of young Americans have become eligible for vaccination. Expanding the scope of vaccination to include adolescents is crucial for protecting their health and well-being, as well as reducing virus transmission within schools and communities.

Looking ahead, experts emphasize the need for continued vigilance until more widespread vaccination coverage is achieved. Variants of the virus, such as the highly transmissible Delta variant, pose a new threat and highlight the importance of maintaining preventive measures in tandem with vaccination efforts.

The achievements made so far should not overshadow the global nature of the pandemic. While high-income countries, like the United States, are making strides in their vaccination campaigns, many low- and middle-income countries still struggle to secure an adequate supply of vaccines. The glaring global vaccine equity gap underscores the urgent need for international collaboration and support to ensure equitable access to vaccines for everyone.

In conclusion, surpassing the halfway mark of fully vaccinated American adults is a significant accomplishment in the ongoing battle against COVID-19. It represents hope for a return to normalcy and offers a glimmer of optimism as the country continues its vaccination campaign. However, the fight is far from over, and ongoing efforts to address vaccine hesitancy, disparities in access, and emerging variants will be crucial in ultimately overcoming the pandemic.",true
11095,"Rare surgery brings more weight loss, more risks","No mention in this lengthy story of the costs of the two procedures or insurance coverage. Readers need this information, and the fact that the duodenal switch may not be covered by most insurance. The total cost of gastric bypass is about $20,000. The story makes clear that the duodenal switch surgery, in comparison with the bariatric surgery, may give patients greater weight loss in pounds but the value of that reduction is not clear. The additional information from the paper published by Livingston demonstrating no advantage to surgery over medical management was very useful. The story shines in its details about the delicate weighing of risk vs. benefits for weight-loss surgery in general, and then for the duodenal vs. gastric bypass method in particular. Some readers might find it confusing that the story includes two separate publications about weight-loss surgery. The story leads with the small study comparing duodenal with gastric bypass, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, but then delves into a larger Veterans Administration study from the Journal of the American Medical Association that looked at the longer-term results of all surgeries for obesity. We salute Reuters for providing the context and the controversy within medical practice, and quoting a principal investigator on the VA study, Edward Livingstone, who wrote an editorial that appeared in the Annals beside the duodenal paper. The story reports on a very small study – just 58 patients in total and 29 received the duodenal surgery. Only one comment addressed the quality of the evidence: “Larger, longer-term studies are still needed to show whether the extra weight loss with duodenal switch” improves the health and lengthens the lives of obese patients, explained lead researcher Torgeir Sovik. We would have liked a reminder of the preliminary nature of the conclusions higher up in the story. This story does a good job of probing territory that is under-explored in most media accounts about obesity treatment. It poses the questions of long-term quality of life and life expectancy post treatment. Could obesity itself be less life-threatening than some of the radical treatments aimed at treating it? In addition to quoting the lead author of the Annals article, we liked the balance provided by Edward Livingston in his comments about both the duodenal switch procedure and his comments about the value of surgery in general over medical management. The story concentrates on patients receiving weight-loss surgery, and does not discuss non-surgical alternatives at much length. It does mention the study by Livingston questioning the value of surgery over medical management. Behavior coaching, diet and exercise are all potential treatments for obesity. The story explains that duodenal switch is “less common” and that “Duodenal switch is not a popular procedure.” In a 2008 study, it accounted for just 1 percent of weight-loss, or bariatric, surgeries done in the U.S., and 5 percent in Europe.” The story makes it clear that the duodenal switch procedure has been around for a number of years but is rarely used. No, it does not rely on a news release.","New Study Shows COVID-19 Variants Posing Higher Risk of Transmission

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, recent research has shed light on the rising threat of virus variants, illustrating their capacity to increase transmission rates. A new study, conducted by a team of international scientists, highlights the urgent need for proactive measures to combat these mutated strains.

The study, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, examined the differing characteristics and transmissibility of several COVID-19 variants, including the highly contagious Delta variant (B.1.617.2). Researchers analyzed viral loads in nasal swabs collected from infected individuals and found significantly higher viral concentrations in those infected with the Delta variant compared to previous strains.

According to lead researcher Dr. Julia Thompson, the findings are worrisome. ""Not only did we observe an increase in viral load with the Delta variant, but we also observed that individuals infected with this variant had viral loads approximately 1,000 times higher than those seen in patients infected with the original strain,"" she explained. ""This indicates a much higher potential for spreading the virus to others.""

The increased transmissibility of the variants presents new challenges for health authorities globally, who are working tirelessly to control the spread of the virus. The study's findings suggest that these efforts must be intensified in order to prevent a surge in cases and potentially overwhelming healthcare systems.

Furthermore, the research team discovered that viral shedding, the release of the virus from an infected person, starts earlier in individuals infected with the Delta variant. This finding implies that infected individuals may become contagious even before displaying symptoms, making it more difficult to identify and isolate cases promptly.

Dr. Thompson emphasized the significance of early detection and testing. ""It is crucial for individuals to get tested as soon as they experience any COVID-19 symptoms or if they have been exposed to someone with a confirmed infection. Timely testing can help mitigate the spread of these highly transmissible variants,"" she stressed.

The Delta variant, initially identified in India, rapidly became the dominant strain in several countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia. Its increased transmissibility has raised concerns about breakthrough infections despite widespread vaccination efforts. While current vaccines provide a high degree of protection against severe illness and hospitalization, studies suggest that they may be slightly less effective at preventing mild or moderate cases of the Delta variant.

Nevertheless, health authorities continue to encourage vaccination as an essential tool in curbing the pandemic's impact and reducing the risk of severe outcomes. ""Although the effectiveness of the vaccines may be slightly diminished against some of these variants, they still offer significant protection and remain the best defense we have against the virus,"" stated Dr. Emma Collins, a leading infectious disease specialist.

Dr. Collins further advised individuals to follow public health guidelines diligently, especially in areas experiencing high transmission rates. This includes proper mask wearing, maintaining physical distance, frequent hand hygiene, and avoiding crowded indoor spaces.

As the world grapples with the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19, the emergence of highly transmissible variants serves as a stern reminder that the battle is far from over. Vigilance, adherence to preventive measures, and efficient vaccination distribution are crucial in preventing the further spread of these variants and ultimately bringing an end to the pandemic.",true
5547,Dutch Supreme Court asked to clarify euthanasia case.,"The Public Prosecution Service said by instituting “cassation in the interest of the law” proceedings they aim to clarify how doctors deal with euthanasia on “incapacitated patients” without subjecting a doctor acquitted at a trial to a new legal battle. Prosecutors said in a statement they want “legal certainty to be created for doctors and patients about this important issue in euthanasia legislation and medical practice.” The retired nursing home doctor was cleared earlier this month by judges in The Hague who ruled that she adhered to all criteria for carrying out legal euthanasia when she administered a fatal dose of drugs to a 74-year-old woman with severe dementia. The cassation proceedings mean that the doctor’s acquittal will not be called into question. The doctor carried out euthanasia on the woman in 2016, acting on a written directive the patient had drawn up earlier. The woman later gave mixed signals about her desire to die, but the doctor, in close consultation with the woman’s family, decided to go ahead with the mercy killing. The Hague District Court ruled that in rare cases of euthanasia on patients with severe dementia — and who had earlier made a written request for euthanasia — the doctor “did not have to verify the current desire to die.” Prosecutors said they disagreed with the Hague court and want the Supreme Court to rule on legal issues in the case. Pending the outcome of the Supreme Court case, prosecutors said they are suspending consideration of other euthanasia cases that deal with the same issues. Under Dutch law, people are eligible for euthanasia if they make a considered, voluntary request and if their suffering is hopelessly “unbearable.” Patients can draw up a written request for euthanasia to be performed sometime in the future, in an advance directive, which should specify the conditions determining when they want to be euthanized. Doctors must also seek the advice of at least one other independent physician before killing the patient. Euthanasia cases among people with advanced dementia are extremely rare in the Netherlands. There have been fewer than 20 cases since the procedure was legalized in 2002. The Netherlands is one of five countries that allow doctors to kill patients at their request, and one of two, along with Belgium, that grant the procedure for people with mental illness.","New Evidence Suggests COVID-19 May Cause Long-Term Lung Damage

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread worldwide, scientists and healthcare professionals are working tirelessly to decipher the long-term effects of the virus on infected individuals. Recent studies have raised concerns about potential long-lasting damage to the lungs even in patients who have recovered from the acute phase of the illness.

Preliminary research conducted by leading medical institutions has shed light on the impact of COVID-19 on lung health. The virus primarily affects the respiratory system, leading to symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and pneumonia. However, there is now growing evidence to indicate that surviving the acute phase of the illness does not guarantee complete recovery for everyone.

In a study published in the journal Respiratory Research, researchers observed a group of 100 adults who had recently recovered from COVID-19. Using various imaging techniques, including chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans, they aimed to evaluate lung function and assess any potential abnormalities.

The results revealed alarming findings: 78% of the participants displayed signs of lingering lung damage, despite having no apparent symptoms. These abnormalities included ground-glass opacities, pulmonary fibrosis, and residual inflammation. Such issues can impair lung function and be detrimental to overall health in the long run.

Furthermore, another study published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine found similar results. Researchers examined the lungs of 44 deceased COVID-19 patients during autopsies and discovered extensive tissue damage caused by inflammation. The study highlighted the presence of small blood clots and scarring within the lung tissues, which can lead to reduced oxygen exchange and respiratory complications.

These findings indicate that even after recovering from the initial infection, survivors may face long-term consequences. Dr. Sarah Thompson, a pulmonologist at a prominent hospital, underscored the significance of these findings, stating, ""We used to think that once patients recovered from COVID-19, they would bounce back to their normal lung health. However, these studies demonstrate that we need to pay close attention to potential long-term lung damage and implement appropriate strategies for rehabilitation and monitoring.""

The implications of these discoveries extend beyond immediate health concerns. With millions of individuals affected by COVID-19 worldwide, the burden on healthcare systems could persist for years due to the need for ongoing monitoring and care for those with lung damage. This serves as a stark reminder of the importance of preventive measures such as social distancing, wearing masks, and vaccination.

In response to this emerging evidence, medical professionals are emphasizing the significance of post-COVID-19 follow-up care. Patients who have recovered are being advised to undergo regular check-ups, including lung function tests and imaging studies, to detect any potential complications early on. Rehabilitation programs involving pulmonary therapy and breathing exercises may also be recommended to improve lung capacity and reduce the risk of further damage.

As the scientific community continues to delve into the long-term effects of COVID-19, these studies serve as crucial wake-up calls for both researchers and the general population. While vaccines offer hope in curbing the spread of the virus, understanding the potential long-lasting consequences of infection is paramount to effectively managing and mitigating the impact of the pandemic.

In the face of this evolving research, public health agencies are urged to incorporate these findings into their guidelines and ensure comprehensive care for recovered patients. Staying vigilant, getting vaccinated, and promoting respiratory health has never been more vital as we strive to navigate the challenges presented by COVID-19 and its aftermath.",true
8832,School closings may be no holiday for flu pandemic.,"An influenza virus vaccine vial sits on the counter of medical center in Great Neck, New York, October 22, 2004. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton SS  But they said school closings would create significant  hardships for working parents, who might be forced to create  informal daycare arrangements that would undo efforts to  contain the spread of flu. “We find school closings would be less effective than some  studies have suggested,” said Dr. Simon Cauchemez of Imperial  College London, whose study appears in the journal Nature. “The main effect would be to slow and flatten the outbreak  — so the numbers becoming ill in the worst week of the  outbreak might be reduced by up to 40 percent, reducing peak  demand on health-care systems,” Cauchemez said in an e-mail. Health experts almost universally agree that a global  epidemic — a pandemic — of influenza is overdue. The most  likely cause now is H5N1 avian influenza, which could evolve  into a form that passes easily from person to person. Government estimates suggest vaccines and drugs will not be  enough to slow or prevent a flu pandemic. The U.S. pandemic  plan recommends closing schools and implementing strategies to  limit social contact as a way to limit transmission. If done quickly, such widespread measures combined with  drugs and vaccines might reduce transmission in a large city by  as much as 80 percent, by one estimate. But such estimates are often based on widely varying  assumptions, Cauchemez said. He and colleagues instead used  public health data from France that compared flu transmission  when school was in session and during school holidays. They found school holidays prevent 16 to 18 percent of  seasonal influenza cases. When extrapolated to a pandemic, they  said prolonged school closure might reduce the cumulative  number of cases by 13 to 17 percent, and peak attack rates by  39 to 45 percent. But that impact would be reduced if it proved too difficult  to keep children apart. “If we want the policy to have an  impact, children must be kept relatively isolated and not cared  for in groups,” Cauchemez said. U.S. cities that quickly closed schools and discouraged  public gatherings during the great flu pandemic of 1918 —  which killed tens of millions of people globally — had as many  as 50 percent fewer deaths than cities that took less decisive  measures, according to a recent study. Cauchemez said an especially deadly pandemic might provide  strong incentives for people to keep their children at home. “It might nonetheless be difficult for a lot of working parents  to be absent from their work for months to look after their  kids,” he said. Cauchemez said a prolonged outbreak might force working  parents to put their children into informal daycare settings, a  risk governments need to consider when they formulate pandemic  flu plans. “We can’t predict how people will behave, but we need to be  aware that if this happens, school closings might have no  effect at all on flu transmission,” he said. H5N1 bird flu only rarely infects people now. It has killed  239 out of 379 infected, according to the World Health  Organization, but could easily mutate into a form that one  person could pass to another, and governments around the world  are preparing for the possibility.","New Study Finds COVID-19 Vaccines Provide Long-Term Protection

A recent study conducted by leading health experts has provided encouraging news regarding the long-term efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. The findings suggest that the current vaccines not only provide robust protection against the virus but also offer long-lasting immune responses.

The study, published in the prestigious medical journal, highlights the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe illness and hospitalization. Researchers followed a cohort of vaccinated individuals over a period of twelve months and observed their immune responses at regular intervals.

The results revealed that the vaccinated individuals maintained strong immunity against COVID-19 throughout the entire duration of the study. Antibody levels remained high, providing protection against the virus and significantly reducing the risk of transmission.

Dr. Sarah Thompson, lead researcher of the study, explained that ""these findings are extremely promising and suggest that the vaccinations we have been administering to combat the pandemic are highly effective in conferring long-term immunity."" She further emphasized the importance of continued vaccination efforts to control the spread of the virus and protect public health.

The study also examined the response of vaccinated individuals to emerging variants of the virus. Despite concerns about new strains potentially evading vaccine-induced immunity, the researchers found that the vaccines performed admirably against these variants. The immune response elicited by the vaccines was effective in neutralizing the variants, underscoring the importance of widespread vaccination campaigns.

Public health officials and experts around the world have lauded the study's findings as a ray of hope in the ongoing battle against COVID-19. Dr. Amanda Carter, a renowned infectious disease specialist, stated that ""this research reinforces the value and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccinations. It provides us with renewed confidence in our ability to combat the virus and its variants.""

The study's results come at a crucial time when countries are grappling with increasing cases and evolving variants. With vaccination rates varying across regions, the findings act as a reminder of the urgent need to accelerate immunization campaigns worldwide.

Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of individuals receiving their booster shots. While initial vaccine doses provide strong protection, an additional dose or booster helps enhance and prolong the immune response, ensuring long-term immunity against COVID-19.

However, despite these promising results, experts emphasize the continued importance of practicing other preventive measures such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. Vaccinations alone cannot control the pandemic entirely, and a comprehensive approach combining vaccines and public health measures remains crucial.

As the world faces an uncertain future with different stages of the pandemic in various regions, this study offers hope and reassurance about the effectiveness and durability of COVID-19 vaccines. It underscores the value of vaccination programs at the national and global levels and serves as a call to action for individuals who are still hesitant to get vaccinated.

It is vital that we continue to follow scientific research and evidence-based approaches to tackle this ongoing crisis. With vaccination as our primary weapon against COVID-19, we must work collectively to ensure that everyone has access to these life-saving vaccines and remain vigilant in implementing necessary precautionary measures. Only by doing so can we achieve the ultimate goal of bringing an end to this devastating pandemic.",true
2732,"GSK upbeat on heart drug, cancer vaccine despite setbacks.","Chief Executive Andrew Witty said on Wednesday there were still “intriguing” opportunities for its heart drug darapladib and MAGE-A3 therapeutic cancer vaccine. Many analysts stripped out forecasts for darapladib, which is designed to prevent heart attacks and strokes in a completely different way from cholesterol-lowering drugs, after it failed to reduce risks in the first of two big final Phase III trials in November. GSK, however, is continuing to investigate the drug’s role in coronary heart disease and Witty told analysts in a call following full-year results that further data on the approach would be presented at a medical meeting next month. He was also upbeat about prospects for the MAGE-A3 cancer vaccine in other tumor settings, despite initial negative results in melanoma in September. Unlike traditional preventative vaccines, MAGE-A3 is designed for people with established disease, helping their immune systems to prevent the return of tumors after surgery. In fact the head of Britain’s biggest drugmaker said both darapladib and MAGE-3 were among the most promising drugs in the company’s pipeline. He also highlighted a new triple combination respiratory drug, a long-acting integrase inhibitor for HIV and a drug for pre-term labor, all of which could start final Phase III clinical testing this year or next.","New Variant of COVID-19 Detected in Several Countries Raises Concerns Over Vaccine Efficacy

A newly emerging variant of the novel coronavirus, dubbed B.1.616, has been identified in several countries, raising concerns about its potential impact on vaccine efficacy and public health measures. Health experts warn that this variant carries a significant number of mutations, possibly impacting the effectiveness of current vaccines and leading to a surge in new infections.

First detected in India, the B.1.616 variant has since been reported in other countries including the United Kingdom, United States, Germany, and Singapore. While it is still too early to determine the exact characteristics and behavior of this new variant, initial findings are causing researchers to closely monitor its potential implications for global health.

One of the most worrisome features of the B.1.616 variant is its numerous mutations, particularly within the spike protein that the virus uses to enter human cells. Mutations in this region have previously been associated with increased transmissibility and reduced efficacy of antibody treatments. It is now feared that these mutations may also affect the ability of vaccines to recognize and neutralize the virus.

Health authorities worldwide have stressed the need for continued vigilance and adherence to public health measures, such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and frequent handwashing. Additionally, efforts to boost vaccination rates have been intensified to curb the spread of this new variant. However, concerns remain over the potential need for vaccine modifications to address the specific mutations found in the B.1.616 variant.

While studies are ongoing to understand the variant's behavior and its impact on vaccine effectiveness, preliminary data suggests that current vaccines, although potentially less effective, still provide crucial protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Nonetheless, experts acknowledge the urgency to adapt and update existing vaccines if necessary.

The emergence of new variants has become a pressing issue in the battle against COVID-19. The B.1.616 variant joins a growing list that includes the highly transmissible Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, among others. These variants have raised concerns about breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals and the possibility of diminishing immunity over time.

Experts emphasize the importance of accelerating global vaccination efforts to reduce the pool of vulnerable individuals and limit the virus's ability to develop new mutations. By achieving high vaccination rates globally, the chances of further emergence and circulation of variants can be significantly reduced.

Health agencies and research institutions are actively monitoring the B.1.616 variant's spread and impact, closely collaborating with one another to expedite the assessment of vaccine effectiveness against this new strain and, if needed, developing updated vaccines or booster shots targeting specific mutations present in the new variant.

In conclusion, the emergence of the B.1.616 variant is raising concerns about the potential impact on vaccine efficacy and public health measures. While current vaccines still offer vital protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death, experts stress the need for continued vigilance, adherence to existing preventive measures, and potentially adapting vaccines to address the specific mutations found in this variant. It remains crucial to accelerate global vaccination efforts to curb the spread of emerging variants and minimize the risk they pose to public health.",true
3925,Medical marijuana in Louisiana: Questions about cost arise.,"Nine pharmacies dispense medicinal-grade pot and set their individual prices. Dispensary owners say their charges reflect an industry with startup charges, small patient numbers and lengthy regulatory hurdles to meet. In August, Louisiana became the first Deep South state — and one of more than 30 states nationwide — to dispense medical marijuana, four years after state lawmakers agreed to give patients access. Now, the state is grappling with the growing pains of a new medical market and a patient group that can’t use health insurance to cover costs. Kathryn Thomas, CEO of The Healing Clinics, said a third of the medical marijuana patients across its five clinics in Shreveport, Monroe, Baton Rouge, Houma and Lafayette can’t foot the bill for the product. “They can’t afford ongoing treatment,” Thomas said. “It’s becoming the program for the elite.” The only cannabis currently available comes in a flavored liquid tincture, a bottle containing a dropper to use. One bottle can range from about $90 to $220, depending on concentration and pharmacy, according to medical marijuana advocates. Dr. Victor Chou, who has a medical marijuana clinic in Baton Rouge with more than 600 patients, said many of his patients take a dosage of about one bottle per month and are finding relief from chronic conditions. But one-quarter of his patients, Chou said, can’t afford the medication. “The average chronic pain patients would be spending maybe $1,000 a month at current prices for what they need,” he said. About 3,500 people have received medical marijuana since the program began, according to the Louisiana Board of Pharmacy. Under state law, Louisiana is allowing cannabis to treat a long list of diseases and disorders, such as cancer, seizure disorders, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder and Parkinson’s disease. “We’re now working through the real kinks of a startup business and industry,” said Jesse McCormick, with the Louisiana Association for Therapeutic Alternatives representing the nine dispensaries. “They’re just like everybody else out here, trying to stay open and keep the lights on.” Only the agricultural centers at Louisiana State University and Southern University are authorized to grow medical marijuana. GB Sciences, LSU’s grower, is the only one currently providing product. John Davis, president of GB Sciences Louisiana, wouldn’t disclose its wholesale prices, but said pharmacies determine their own markups. McCormick said the pharmacies have higher tax liabilities and banking costs than other businesses, and he said some Louisiana dispensaries built facilities and carried costs for months with no income waiting for cannabis products. “I finally came up with our prices the night before we opened. It really was based on our expenses and what we had spent and lost, and what we needed to recover in five years,” said Doug Boudreaux, a pharmacist and co-owner of the Shreveport medical marijuana dispensary Hope Pharmacy. Pharmacies say if they get more patients, prices will go down. They say any addition of new products also will help, such as plans to offer dissolving strips taken by mouth and topical creams. Doctors and patients hope the addition of a second grower would drive down costs. Southern’s grower, Ilera Holistic Healthcare, is setting up operations, with plans to have medical marijuana on pharmacy shelves next year. Ilera CEO Chanda Macias said the company will have a manufactured-suggested retail price for products and will stress customer affordability to pharmacies. Chou’s hopeful the cost difficulties some patients are having will be addressed. “I want to be clear: there are a lot of people who are getting a really, really good benefit out of this. I have many people who tell me they’ve been totally pain free for the first time in years,” he said. ___ Follow Melinda Deslatte on Twitter at http://twitter.com/melindadeslatte","New COVID-19 Variant Discovered in South Africa Raises Concerns 

In a troubling development, a new variant of the novel coronavirus has been identified in South Africa, causing heightened alarm among health officials and experts worldwide. The emergence of this variant, known as B.1.351, raises concerns about its potential impact on transmission rates, vaccine effectiveness, and the overall global containment efforts.

South African scientists first detected the B.1.351 variant in October 2020. Since then, it has rapidly become the dominant strain in many parts of the country. Researchers believe that this variant is more contagious than earlier versions of the virus, with an increased potential for reinfection even among those who have already recovered from COVID-19.

One of the primary reasons for concern surrounding the B.1.351 variant is its potential to evade immunity built up through prior infection or vaccination. Preliminary studies suggest that certain antibodies generated by existing vaccines may be less effective in neutralizing this particular variant. While the vaccines still provide some level of protection against severe illness and hospitalization, this new challenge may necessitate future updates to existing vaccine formulations.

The B.1.351 variant carries several mutations in the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which enables it to bind more tightly to human cells. This enhanced binding capability could potentially increase transmission rates, making it more difficult to contain the spread of the virus. As a result, countries around the world have intensified their travel restrictions and quarantine measures to limit the importation of this variant.

Amidst concerns about the B.1.351 variant, experts are urging individuals to remain vigilant in following public health guidelines. Wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and frequently washing hands continue to be crucial in preventing the spread of all known variants of the coronavirus. Additionally, health authorities recommend promptly getting vaccinated as soon as the vaccine becomes available to each individual.

Recognizing the need for ongoing research and monitoring, scientists are investigating the efficacy of existing vaccines against the B.1.351 variant. Pharmaceutical companies are also exploring the possibility of developing booster shots tailored specifically to address this new strain. Such efforts aim to ensure that immunity is not compromised as the virus continues to evolve.

While the identification of a new variant poses challenges in the fight against COVID-19, it also highlights the importance of genomic surveillance and rapid information sharing among nations. Prompt detection and analysis of emerging variants are crucial to adapting containment strategies effectively and minimizing the impact on public health.

As the global battle against the pandemic wages on, experts emphasize the need for continued adherence to preventive measures. Vaccination campaigns remain critical, even with the presence of new variants. Public health authorities and scientific communities must work collectively to monitor the situation closely, share data rapidly, and adapt strategies to combat the evolving virus.

The discovery of the B.1.351 variant serves as a stark reminder that the threat posed by the coronavirus remains ever-present, necessitating constant vigilance and a proactive approach to mitigating its impact. By staying informed and acting responsibly, individuals can play their part in defending against this dangerous pathogen and helping bring an end to this devastating global crisis.",true
8009,"Italy's epidemic should stabilize soon, but vigilance needed: WHO.","Italy has registered more deaths than anywhere else in the world and accounts for more than a third of all global fatalities from the virus. In Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus emerged in December and which is now reopening after two months of lockdown, authorities have maintained physical distancing measures and continue to search for cases, Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emergencies expert, said. “What we are likely to see, if you imagine the lockdown and stringent measures in Italy are now in place 2-3 weeks ... we should start to see stabilization because the cases we see today really reflect exposures two weeks ago,” he told journalists at a virtual briefing in Geneva. The death toll from the outbreak of coronavirus in Italy climbed by 812 to 11,591, the Civil Protection Agency said on Monday, reversing two days of declines in the daily rate. However, the number of new cases rose by just 4,050, the lowest amount since March 17, hitting a total 101,739 from a previous 97,689. Spain overtook China in the number of those infected with coronavirus on Monday, as the government tightened restrictions on a population entering its third week under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. But the daily increase in infections began to slow. “So we do hope that Italy and Spain are nearly there on that ... And going down (on case numbers) isn’t just about a lockdown and let go,” Ryan said. Regarding the use of masks by the public - amid a global shortage of supplies for health care workers - Ryan said: “In general WHO recommends that the wearing of a mask by a member of the public is to prevent that individual giving the disease to somebody else. “We don’t generally recommend wearing of masks in public by otherwise well individuals because it has not been up to now associated with any particular benefit.”","COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution: Progress and Challenges

The global battle against COVID-19 continues as countries strive to vaccinate their populations. Governments and health organizations around the world have been working tirelessly to procure and distribute vaccines, but several challenges lie ahead before herd immunity can be achieved.

Since the emergence of the first COVID-19 vaccines, millions of doses have been administered worldwide. The vaccination campaign began with frontline healthcare workers and vulnerable populations. While the initial progress has been significant, there are still many hurdles to overcome.

One primary challenge is the equitable distribution of vaccines. Developed nations secured contracts and stockpiled doses for their citizens early on, leaving developing countries with limited access. This disparity raises concerns about global health equity and leaves populations in low-income countries vulnerable to the virus's spread.

To address this issue, international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and COVAX have been working diligently to ensure fair vaccine distribution. COVAX, an initiative led by WHO, aims to provide equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, especially for less developed nations. However, logistical issues, supply chain challenges, and vaccine hesitancy complicate the process.

Logistics present a significant hurdle in vaccine distribution. Vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna require ultra-cold storage, posing difficulties for countries with limited infrastructure. Developing nations often lack the necessary cold chain systems to preserve the vaccine's efficacy during transportation and storage. Establishing specialized storage facilities and training personnel requires both time and resources.

Supply chain challenges also arise due to the unprecedented demand for vaccines worldwide. Manufacturing and distributing billions of doses within a short timeframe is a monumental task. Delays in production, export restrictions, and trade barriers further exacerbate the problem, hindering the timely delivery of vaccines to those in need.

Another hurdle involves vaccine hesitancy among certain populations. Misinformation, skepticism, and trust issues surrounding the vaccines have fueled hesitancy in some communities. Overcoming this challenge requires robust public health messaging campaigns and targeted outreach efforts to educate individuals about the vaccine's safety and efficacy.

Despite these challenges, several countries have made significant strides in their vaccination campaigns. Israel, for example, has one of the highest vaccination rates globally, with over half of its population fully vaccinated. Similarly, the United States, the United Kingdom, and parts of Europe have successfully administered millions of doses.

In addition to distribution challenges, new variants of the virus pose a threat to global vaccination efforts. Recent studies suggest that certain variants, such as those first detected in South Africa and Brazil, may be more resistant to the current vaccines. Scientists and manufacturers are closely monitoring these developments, emphasizing the need for continuous research and potential vaccine modifications.

As the world awaits widespread vaccine availability, it is crucial to acknowledge the progress made while remaining vigilant in controlling the pandemic. Adhering to public health guidelines, such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and testing, remains essential, even for vaccinated individuals.

Vaccinating the global population against COVID-19 is an immense task that requires collaboration, prioritization, and innovation. The road ahead may be challenging, but diligent efforts from governments, organizations, and communities worldwide can pave the way for a healthier future.",true
5246,Rate increase approved for addiction treatment centers.,"The drug and alcohol treatment centers had been getting more money since 2014, when the state expanded its Medicaid program by using federal money to put people on private health plans that paid more. But in reauthorizing the program for five years, the state is switching to a managed care model with lower reimbursement rates set by the state. Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeffrey Meyers told the council Wednesday his department was able to increase the rates while staying within its budget, and that compensation for high-intensity, residential addiction services will increase from $162 to $347 per day starting Jan. 1. The department adjusted the rates after looking at the other New England states in addition to states like Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky that also have been hard hit by the crisis. While New Hampshire’s reimbursement rates for outpatient services were generally in line with other state, its rates for residential treatment were significantly lower, Meyers said. “We are now very consistent with our surrounding states,” he said. New Hampshire has one of the nation’s highest rates of overdose deaths. After more than doubling in five years, there were two more fatal overdoses last year — 487 in total — than in 2016. Given those numbers, Councilor Chris Pappas, a Democrat, sought assurances that the reimbursement rate hike would ensure that services would not be cut. The new rates will be in effect for six months, but Meyers said he is confident that ensuring adequate services will be a focus during the next budget process. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu agreed. “Because we are now paying rates that are commensurate with the surrounding area, there’s no reason to feel that any of the services would be denied or cut because we’re on par with everyone else,” Sununu said. Cheryl Wilkie, chief operating officer at the Farnum Center in Manchester, called the vote a step in the right direction. But she said the increase excludes covering costs for detox services and does not apply to non-opioid treatment, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of the Medicaid clients it serves. “This is real progress, but there is still a gap in reimbursements that puts great pressure on nonprofits’ ability to afford to provide this treatment,” she said.","J&J COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Paused Amid Safety Concerns

In a significant development, the distribution of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) COVID-19 vaccine has been temporarily halted across the United States following reports of rare blood clotting events among a small number of recipients. The decision was made jointly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), emphasizing their commitment to safety and thorough investigation.

As of now, the CDC and FDA have identified six cases of a severe blood clotting disorder, known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), out of the over 6.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine administered nationwide. These cases occurred in women between the ages of 18 and 48, with symptoms appearing within two weeks after receiving the vaccine. In addition to CVST, these individuals also experienced low levels of blood platelets, a condition called thrombocytopenia.

Although these events are extremely rare, the temporary suspension of the J&J vaccine aims to provide healthcare providers and regulators an opportunity to investigate and assess the situation more thoroughly. This pause will enable healthcare providers to identify potential additional cases, educate themselves about treatment options, and inform patients about the observed side effects.

The CDC and FDA are actively working to ensure that healthcare professionals are aware of the potential risks associated with the J&J vaccine and can appropriately manage any adverse reactions. They are urging individuals who recently received the J&J vaccine and are experiencing severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath within three weeks of vaccination to seek medical help promptly.

It is important to note that similar cases of blood clotting have not been reported with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines currently being administered across the country. The mRNA technology used in these vaccines differs from the viral vector technology employed in the J&J vaccine. The mRNA vaccines carry the genetic instructions to produce a harmless piece of the spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while the J&J vaccine uses a disabled adenovirus to deliver a piece of the viral DNA. Experts believe that this difference may explain the contrasting safety profiles among the three vaccines.

The temporary halt in distributing the J&J vaccine is aimed at providing reassurance to the public and maintaining trust in the vaccine rollout process. It showcases the rigorous monitoring and safety measures established by regulatory authorities to protect the health and well-being of individuals taking part in vaccination campaigns.

Health officials predict that the suspension will likely last for a few days or weeks while data is analyzed and risks are thoroughly evaluated. Given that the J&J vaccine represents only a small fraction of the overall vaccine supply in the United States, it is expected that the impact on the ongoing immunization efforts will be minimal.

As more information becomes available and investigations progress, updates will be provided to ensure a well-informed public. Although this pause may slow down the vaccine distribution temporarily, it underscores the prioritization of safety in the nation's vaccination campaign and demonstrates that careful monitoring systems are in place to identify any potential adverse effects promptly.",true
145,CVS drug coverage plan based on outside pricing review is off to a slow start.,"The company has held back on marketing the pharmacy benefit plan while it talks to these groups, CVS said. The plan, launched a year ago, is based on analyses by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a Boston-based group that assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices. Using ICER’s cost effectiveness assessment, CVS decides whether to include second or third medicines entering the market if there are already similar ones in the plan. Opposition to the CVS plan is part of much broader concerns cited by drug companies and advocacy groups, many of which receive funding from the pharmaceutical industry. Some say that ICER’s analysis based on additional years of “quality life” gained from a given treatment is arbitrary and disregards the costs of drug development and patient needs. More than 50 groups, including drugmakers, PhRMA, the industry’s main lobby group, and other advocacy groups, have provided comment during a public input period included in a review by ICER of its assessment methods. Many asked ICER to eliminate price recommendations from its efficacy analyses. ICER has defended its methods, which are based on a widely-used cost effectiveness analysis. The soft rollout of CVS’ ICER-related product comes as employer health plan sponsors - its biggest clients - are showing increased concern over their cost for new high-priced  drugs, and are considering refusing to pay for them at all, CVS Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan said in a recent interview. If corporate customers follow through on that threat, CVS said it could change tactics with the plan. Rising drug prices, particularly for expensive specialty treatments for severe or deadly conditions, have pushed annual U.S. healthcare spending to $3.65 trillion, and made them unaffordable for many individuals. Earlier this year, Novartis AG (NOVN.S) launched Zolgensma, a more than $2 million gene therapy for a rare but deadly disease called spinal muscular atrophy. The new CVS program, cited as an example of ICER’s growing influence on U.S. drug pricing, would not apply to such a breakthrough treatment. It is a tiny plan by CVS standards as the company manages pharmaceutical benefits for more than 102 million people and also owns Aetna insurance and a national pharmacy chain. The plan’s scope is limited to so-called me too drugs, those where similar effective treatments already exist, and aims to pressure drugmakers to set lower prices. For example, two of three very similar drugs for migraine approved in 2018 could have been excluded, but drugmakers set prices ICER deemed cost effective. CVS has limited sales and marketing for the plan while it talks to patient groups who oppose it. About 240,000 CVS employees and a few large clients’ employees are enrolled thus far. The company declined to comment on exact membership. “We are not widely promoting this program,” Brennan said, adding that CVS is working to address patient groups’ concerns. Meanwhile, Brennan said some employers are considering  refusing to pay for million-dollar treatments like gene therapy. They are saying, “I’m not going to cover these kinds of therapies no matter what their comparative effectiveness is if they’ve got a really high cost.”  Large healthcare consultant and brokerage Mercer said it has begun to field similar concerns. “We have certainly gotten some plan sponsors saying ‘What if we don’t cover specialty drugs?’” said David Dross, who runs Mercer’s managed pharmacy practice. Two years ago, it never received any such questions, he said. Steve Wojcik, an executive with the National Business Group on Health which represents large employers, said he does not believe many will take that drastic step. Still, ICER President Steven Pearson said employers tell him they worry about their ability to cover everything and have suggested they might drop some high-cost treatments. He said employers can use cost effectiveness analysis to help them manage their spending. ICER has responded to outside criticism by meeting with patient advocates and by adding new measurements for a drug’s effectiveness, such as the value of life years gained, which does not focus on quality of life improvements, Pearson said. Since 2015, ICER has published up to a dozen reviews each year of drugs and classes of medicines. Most U.S. private insurers now use ICER clinical and cost analyses to inform coverage negotiations with drugmakers. ICER funding primarily comes from a non-profit foundation, but drug companies and health insurers provide some funds for ICER-related activities.","New Study Shows Dramatic Drop in COVID-19 Hospitalizations After Vaccination Campaign

COVID-19 hospitalizations have significantly declined following a successful vaccination campaign, according to a recent study conducted by the National Institute of Health. The findings provide compelling evidence that widespread vaccination efforts are key to curbing the spread of the virus and preventing severe illness.

The study analyzed data from over 10,000 individuals who were admitted to hospitals across the country due to COVID-19 between January and June of this year. Researchers divided the population into two groups: those who had received both doses of the vaccine and those who were unvaccinated.

The results were striking. Among the vaccinated group, hospitalization rates were reduced by a staggering 89%. In contrast, the unvaccinated group experienced a comparatively modest decline of only 32%. This stark discrepancy demonstrates the effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing severe illness and the need for continued vaccination campaigns.

""These findings confirm what we already suspected ?C that the vaccines are highly effective at preventing hospitalizations,"" said Dr. Sarah Johnson, lead researcher of the study. ""It's clear that vaccination plays a crucial role not only in protecting individuals but also in reducing the burden on healthcare systems.""

Furthermore, the study revealed that the vaccinated group had shorter hospital stays compared to their unvaccinated counterparts. On average, vaccinated individuals spent five days in the hospital, while the unvaccinated group had a median stay of nine days. This indicates that vaccination not only reduces the risk of hospitalization but also aids in faster recovery.

Dr. Johnson emphasized the importance of prioritizing vaccinations, particularly among vulnerable populations. ""Our data suggests that increasing vaccination rates among high-risk individuals, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, can have a significant impact on lowering hospitalization rates,"" she explained.

The study also assessed the impact of specific vaccine types. The majority of vaccinated individuals in the study had received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, and both demonstrated similar efficacy in preventing hospitalizations. Although there were fewer cases involving individuals who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the study's authors noted that more data is required to draw conclusions regarding its effectiveness.

These findings come at a critical time as countries worldwide grapple with the Delta variant and strive to control virus transmission. Vaccination campaigns have been successful in various regions, resulting in declining infection rates and easing pressures on health systems.

Dr. Anthony Martinez, a public health expert, praised the study's results and reminded the public of the importance of continuing vaccination efforts. ""This research reinforces what we already know ?C vaccines save lives,"" he stated. ""To protect ourselves and our communities, adherence to public health guidelines and vaccination should remain top priorities.""

As vaccine hesitancy remains a challenge in some communities, these findings offer compelling evidence of the benefits of vaccination. By reducing the risk of severe illness and hospitalization, widespread vaccination not only protects individuals but also contributes to the overall population's safety and well-being. With this new data, health authorities can further bolster their efforts to encourage vaccination and combat the ongoing threat of COVID-19.",true
2728,Toxin at heart of drug recall shows holes in medical safety net.,"China’s Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical (600521.SS), which produces bulk ingredients for drugmakers, told its customers in late June it had found NDMA in its valsartan, an off-patent blood pressure drug originally developed by Novartis (NOVN.S). The discovery means that some of the 10 billion pills containing valsartan sold worldwide last year to prevent heart attacks and strokes had traces of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), classified as a probable human carcinogen. No one has been reported as sickened by the toxin, once used in the production of liquid rocket fuel. Regulators and industry experts say the toxin almost certainly was introduced when Huahai changed the way it produced valsartan in 2012 - a modification that was signed off on by the European body that sets standards. Subsequent inspections by European, U.S. and Chinese regulators also found no problem. “Everyone failed – the company, the inspectors, the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration), the Europeans, the Chinese,” said Philippe André, an independent pharmaceutical auditor who inspected two Huahai facilities last August and found no critical concerns. “It’s a system failure.”  Reuters was unable to determine how Huahai first discovered the problem. In a July 7 statement released through the Shanghai Stock Exchange, it said it detected the toxin during the “optimization and evaluation” of its manufacturing process. A Novartis spokesman told Reuters that its generic drugs arm, Sandoz, spotted the NDMA in the course of intensive testing to prepare for expanding its purchases of valsartan. He declined to comment further, including on the identity of the manufacturer or when the tests took place. Two other smaller bulk suppliers - Zhejiang Tianyu Pharmaceutical 300702.SZ and a unit of India’s Hetero Drugs - have since also discovered traces of NDMA in some of their valsartan. The three companies declined to comment to comment about the case. For a graphic on heart drug widely used, click tmsnrt.rs/2KnaxAx  Huahai said in a document released through the Shanghai Stock Exchange it changed the production process to reduce waste and improve yields. “The NDMA impurity was produced in trace amounts during the normal manufacturing process according to the company’s current registered process,” it said in a statement on July 24. “All changes in the company’s valsartan manufacturing process have been approved by each country’s drug regulator, and the company manufactures in compliance with legal and regulatory standards.”  The European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulator, which first publicly raised the alarm in a statement on July 5, told valsartan suppliers in a subsequent memo dated July 16 that the NDMA may have been connected to the combined use of the solvent dimethylformamide and sodium nitrite. The FDA is also going on that hypothesis, said Janet Woodcock, director of its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. She stressed the investigation was still going on. “This (NDMA) was not what you look for in an inspection,” Woodcock said in an interview. “If you don’t test for this you’re not going to have an idea that it’s in there, and you’re not going to see it on an inspection.”  The European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM), responsible for setting manufacturing standards, told Reuters it was aware the solvent was being used when it approved the changed process, but that NDMA as a by-product was unexpected and not tested for. Detecting NDMA would have required gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, a very sensitive level of testing, an EDQM spokeswoman said. “These techniques are not normally used routinely to test pharmaceutical products,” she said. Built by Novartis into the $6 billion-a-year brand Diovan, valsartan’s European and U.S. patents expired in 2011 and 2012. Global sales totaled 10.4 billion pills last year, including combination products, healthcare data consultancy IQVIA estimates. People with high blood pressure typically take one pill daily and heart failure patients two. More than 50 companies around the world making finished tablets from the tainted valsartan have recalled products in recent weeks, according a Reuters analysis of national medicines agencies’ records. They include major generic drug manufacturers such as Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA), Ranbaxy Laboratories and Sandoz. Based on the average NDMA impurity detected at Huahai of 60 parts per million (ppm), the EMA says there could be one additional case of cancer in every 5,000 people taking the highest dose for seven years. The contamination puts a spotlight on manufacturers in China and India, which supply more than two-thirds of all active pharmaceutical ingredients used in medicines, industry executives estimate. China accounts for the lion’s share. Huahai, founded in 1989 and listed in Shanghai in 2003, was one of the first Chinese companies to get drugs approved in the U.S. market. The FDA has inspected the site that made the contaminated valsartan three times since 2010, its records show. European inspectors also visited regularly. The provincial branch of the Chinese FDA (CFDA) also inspected Huahai facilities 10 times in connection with new drug applications between January 2016 and June 2018, the national online database shows. U.S. and European regulators have increased scrutiny of  Chinese and Indian drug factories after the adulteration of the blood thinner heparin sickened hundreds and caused the deaths of at least 81 Americans in 2007 and 2008. The CFDA is also on alert. Last month, it revealed that Changsheng Bio-technology 002680.SZ, a vaccine maker, had fabricated data and sold ineffective vaccines for children. It also found that a diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine sold by the state-owned Wuhan Institute of Biological Products was substandard. The fact that international inspections do not appear to have detected the NDMA contamination alarms Anders Fuglsang, a former European medicines regulator who runs a pharmaceutical consultancy in Denmark. “We need to ask ourselves how it is possible - despite  pharmacopoeias and agency guidelines, inspection programs with coordination across continents, a system of public quality control, and companies complying with all rules - that a nasty carcinogen can find its way into our drugs and be there for years without anyone noticing,” he said.","Pandemic Fatigue: The Mental Health Consequences of COVID-19

COVID-19 has upended lives across the globe for over a year, leaving individuals grappling with fear, uncertainty, and unprecedented changes to their daily routines. As the pandemic drags on, many are experiencing what experts call ""pandemic fatigue,"" a state of exhaustion that encompasses not only physical tiredness but also emotional and mental strain.

The toll on mental health has been one of the most significant impacts of the ongoing pandemic. Measures such as lockdowns, social distancing, and isolation have led to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and stress. However, with the prolonged duration of restrictive measures, the mental health consequences are becoming even more apparent.

Pandemic fatigue, resulting from an extended period of living under the shadow of the virus, is characterized by feelings of restlessness, irritability, and frustration. It stems from the profound weariness individuals experience as they continue to adapt their lives to the ever-changing circumstances caused by the pandemic.

Experts believe that pandemic fatigue is driven by several factors. Firstly, the relentless nature of the crisis leads to a sense of hopelessness and resignation. With each ebb and flow of the virus, individuals may experience a loss of motivation to adhere to preventive measures due to perceived ineffectiveness or fatigue towards constantly adapting to new guidelines.

Secondly, the absence of regular social interactions takes a toll on mental well-being. Humans are social creatures, and the long-term effects of limited personal connections can result in loneliness, sadness, and decreased overall life satisfaction.

Additionally, the disruption to familiar routines and the lack of opportunities for leisure activities exacerbate stress levels. Work-from-home setups, homeschooling, and constant blurring of boundaries between personal and professional life further compound these challenges. For many individuals, the ability to relax and recharge has become increasingly elusive, leading to heightened burnout and fatigue.

Moreover, the constant flood of pandemic-related news and information contributes to heightened anxiety levels. Staying informed is crucial, but the overwhelming influx of statistics, reports, and conflicting updates can amplify stress and uncertainty, leaving individuals mentally drained.

Recognizing and addressing pandemic fatigue is essential for maintaining mental well-being. Experts emphasize the importance of self-care strategies such as establishing a routine, engaging in regular exercise, getting enough sleep, and practicing mindfulness techniques. Maintaining social connections, albeit virtually, can provide a vital support system during these trying times.

Additionally, healthcare professionals advise individuals to limit exposure to excessive news consumption, focusing on reputable sources for accurate and reliable information. Implementing periods of digital detox, where one disconnects from screens and engages in alternative activities, can also help alleviate mental strain.

It is equally important for governments and institutions to prioritize mental health services and support structures. Expanding telehealth services and ensuring access to counseling and resources are critical steps to providing aid to those suffering from pandemic fatigue.

Ultimately, navigating pandemic fatigue requires collective efforts from individuals, communities, and authorities. By acknowledging the widespread mental health consequences and taking proactive steps to address them, we can mitigate the long-term impact of this enduring crisis.

As the world continues its battle against COVID-19, it is crucial to remember that physical health is not the only aspect affected. The toll on mental well-being cannot be overlooked or underestimated. By recognizing the signs of pandemic fatigue and implementing strategies to combat it, we can build resilience and protect our mental health during these challenging times.",true

The task force unanimously recommended that hotels be limited to half their capacity, though the limit would not apply to motels with outdoor access to rooms or to inns and bed-and-breakfasts with 10 or fewer rooms. Face masks would be required for staffers and are recommended for guests, who would be asked at check-in about any possible exposure to the coronavirus. A reopening date of May 22 is recommended for lodging, but target dates for other sectors were not included. On attractions, the guidance covers activities in “recreational and natural settings,” including biking, canoe and kayak rentals, mini-golf, driving ranges, shooting ranges, and racetracks. Also included are small group tours such those offered at Lost River Gorge and the Polar Caves, but task force members said amusement parks, water parks and indoor attractions would be addressed later. Outdoor attractions would be limited to half their capacity, or to the number social distancing guidelines can accommodate, whichever is less. The requirement would be the same for gyms and fitness clubs, which also would be prohibited from enrolling out-of-state residents as new members.

The town board discussed the matter during a virtual meeting Monday but didn’t vote on it. Jim Keller, the selectman who wrote the proposal, said the main concern is to protect residents from visitors from Massachusetts, where the outbreak is worse, WMUR-TV  reported. Some callers disagreed and believed the fine was too high. In Massachusetts, residents must wear face coverings in public or face fines of as much as $300. ___ THE NUMBERS As of Monday, 3,239 people in New Hampshire had tested positive for the virus, an increase of 81 from the previous day. There have been at least 142 coronavirus-related deaths in the state. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. ___ Associated Press writer Kathy McCormack contributed to this report.","'COVID-19 Vaccination: The Key to Achieving Herd Immunity'

As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing pandemic, governments and healthcare systems are collaborating to accelerate the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. With new variants emerging and cases surging in some regions, achieving herd immunity through widespread vaccination campaigns has become more critical than ever.

Herd immunity, also known as population immunity, refers to the resistance to the spread of a contagious disease within a population. It occurs when a significant portion of individuals have become immune either through prior infection or vaccination, hindering the virus's ability to find susceptible hosts. Reaching this milestone not only protects those who are immunized but also offers indirect protection to those who cannot receive the vaccine due to medical reasons or age.

The importance of obtaining herd immunity against COVID-19 cannot be overstated. It represents our best chance of returning to normalcy, reopening economies, and ensuring the safety of vulnerable populations at greatest risk from severe illness or complications. Experts estimate that anywhere between 70% to 90% of the global population needs to be vaccinated to achieve this level of collective defense.

In recent months, multiple countries across the globe have launched massive vaccination campaigns, prioritizing vulnerable groups such as healthcare workers, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions. By making vaccines accessible and offering clear information about their efficacy and safety, these nations are making significant strides toward immunization targets.

Governments are working diligently to address vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, with public health officials emphasizing the scientific evidence supporting COVID-19 vaccinations. Rigorous testing has shown that authorized vaccines have undergone extensive trials and passed various safety standards before gaining approval for emergency use. Additionally, data from real-world studies demonstrates the effectiveness of these vaccines in reducing the severity of illness, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by the virus.

However, despite the remarkable progress, challenges persist in the race to vaccinate large populations. Limited supplies and uneven distribution have slowed down efforts in many regions, leaving some communities more vulnerable to the virus's impact. To overcome these hurdles, leaders must prioritize equitable distribution, ensuring that vaccines reach all corners of society, including marginalized communities and underprivileged countries.

Equally important is addressing vaccine supply chain issues and ensuring that production capacity keeps up with the increasing demand for doses worldwide. Governments and pharmaceutical companies are working hand-in-hand to ramp up manufacturing capabilities, streamline distribution channels, and collaborate on technology transfer initiatives. By fostering international cooperation and knowledge-sharing, we can accelerate global vaccination efforts and bring an end to this devastating pandemic.

Furthermore, as new variants emerge, scientists and researchers are actively studying their potential impact on vaccine effectiveness. Preliminary data suggest that currently approved vaccines remain effective against existing variants, but continued surveillance and development of updated vaccine strains may be necessary in the future.

The path to herd immunity lies in adherence to public health measures alongside widespread immunization efforts. While vaccines play a vital role, it is essential to complement their deployment with continued mask usage, social distancing, and frequent hand hygiene. These preventative measures will continue to help mitigate the spread of the virus, especially during the initial stages of vaccine rollout when the majority of the population remains unvaccinated.

As we navigate the complexities of the vaccination process, it is crucial to remain vigilant, responsive, and informed. The collective effort of individuals, healthcare systems, and policymakers will shape our journey towards overcoming this global crisis. By prioritizing access, education, and efficient distribution, we can work together to achieve herd immunity, safeguard lives, and reclaim a sense of normalcy in our societies.",true
2903,CareFusion to pay $40 million to settle U.S. kickbacks lawsuit.,"The accord announced on Thursday by the U.S. Department of Justice resolves allegations that CareFusion violated the federal False Claims Act by paying $11.6 million to a doctor to promote its ChloraPrep product to healthcare providers. That doctor, Charles Denham, received the kickbacks while serving as co-chair of the safe practices committee of the nonprofit National Quality Forum, which makes recommendations on healthcare practices, the Justice Department said. “Corrupting the standard-setting process through kickbacks can affect the healthcare treatment choices that doctors and hospitals may make for patients,” Stuart Delery, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s civil division, said in a statement. The lawsuit also claimed that CareFusion promoted ChloraPrep from September 2009 through August 2011 for unapproved uses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved ChloraPrep to prepare patients’ skin for surgery or injections. CareFusion said on Thursday that it set aside funds for the settlement in the first quarter of 2013. Chief Executive Officer Kieran Gallahue said the San Diego-based company is pleased to settle, and has made “significant investments” to improve its quality and compliance practices, including in sales and marketing. Denham could not immediately be reached for comment. The accord resolved a whistleblower lawsuit first brought in September 2010 by Cynthia Kirk, a former vice president of regulatory affairs at a CareFusion infection prevention unit.

Today, I bring you an important update on the current state of public health: '{summary}'.

In recent months, the world has been grappling with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. With millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide, it is evident that this virus continues to be a significant threat to global health and well-being.

'{Summary}' is a claim that encapsulates the key issues concerning public health during these trying times. This could refer to a range of topics, such as the efficacy of vaccines, the impact of lockdown measures, the emergence of new variants, or the management of overwhelmed healthcare systems.

One pressing issue that '{summary}' underscores is the importance of vaccination in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Vaccines have proven to be highly effective in reducing severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by the virus. Authorities around the world have launched extensive vaccination campaigns, aiming to immunize their populations and achieve herd immunity. It is crucial for individuals to follow the guidance of health experts and get vaccinated to protect themselves and others from this devastating disease.

However, another aspect of '{summary}' may revolve around the challenges faced by healthcare systems in dealing with the ever-increasing number of COVID-19 cases. Hospitals are overwhelmed, medical staff are exhausted, and resources are stretched thin. This situation highlights the need for robust healthcare infrastructure and effective crisis management strategies. Governments must focus on bolstering healthcare systems, ensuring sufficient equipment, and providing support to frontline workers who tirelessly battle the virus.

Additionally, the emergence of new variants has sparked concerns among public health officials. Variants like Delta, Alpha, and Beta have shown increased transmissibility or potential resistance to existing treatments and vaccines. Continuous genomic surveillance, rapid testing, and strict travel protocols are crucial in controlling the spread of these variants and preventing further surges in cases.

'{Summary}' can also reflect the impact of lockdown measures on mental health and socioeconomic well-being. While lockdowns have been essential in curbing the spread of the virus, they have had adverse effects on society. Isolation, job losses, and disrupted education have taken a toll on individuals and communities. It is vital for policymakers to strike a balance between protecting public health and minimizing the negative consequences of restrictive measures, offering support services and economic relief to those in need.

Lastly, '{summary}' may signify the global effort required to overcome this pandemic. COVID-19 knows no boundaries, and international collaboration is paramount in tackling this global threat. Sharing knowledge, expertise, and resources among countries is fundamental in developing effective strategies for containing the virus and preventing future pandemics.

In conclusion, '{summary}' encapsulates various aspects of the ongoing public health crisis. Vaccination, healthcare system management, variant surveillance, mental health support, and global cooperation are all integral components in addressing the challenges posed by COVID-19. By staying informed, adhering to recommended guidelines, and supporting one another, humanity can collectively surpass this difficult period and aspire towards a healthier and safer future.",true
8861,FDA pinpoints contaminant in Baxter's heparin.,"Food and Drug Administration officials said they are trying  to determine whether the chemical — over-sulfated chondroitin  sulfate — was purposely or inadvertently added during  manufacturing in China. “We don’t know whether the contaminant was introduced  intentionally or by accident,” said Dr. Janet Woodcock,  director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Chondroitin sulfate is widely sold as a dietary supplement  to treat joint pain. The over-sulfated version is not known to  occur naturally and therefore likely was chemically modified,  Woodcock told reporters on a conference call. It is still unclear whether the contaminant is the cause of  up to 19 deaths and hundreds of serious breathing problems and  other reactions reported to the FDA, she said. The substance mimics the blood-thinning actions of heparin  but is not FDA-approved for use in medicines, Woodcock said. In  some batches, the contaminant accounted for between 2 percent  and 50 percent of the samples, she said. FDA officials said chemically manipulating chondroitin  sulfate, which is widely available from animal sources, would  be cheaper than getting raw heparin from pig intestines. Last year, the FDA found pet food ingredients imported from  China were tainted, killing more than 200 cats and dogs and  causing widespread alarm. The Chinese maker involved was later  indicted in the United States for fraud over adding the  chemical melamine in an attempt to bolster the value of its  ingredient. The pet food case drew attention to China’s role in the  U.S. food and drug supply and ignited criticism over the FDA’s  lack of oversight — and little cooperation from its Chinese  counterparts. This time around, FDA officials said they are getting  needed help from China. “It’s quite a different scenario than we had a year ago,”  FDA’s Deputy Commissioner for International Affairs Murray  Lumpkin, told reporters on the phone, while speaking from  China. FDA’s Woodcock said it remains unclear whether the heparin  contamination was intentional. Many scientists are studying  over-sulfated chondroitin sulfate, which could have  accidentally made its way into heparin products, she said. The FDA announced on March 5 it had found a “heparin-like”  contaminant in some of the drug’s active ingredient supplied to  Baxter by a plant in Changzhou, China, owned by Wisconsin-based  Scientific Protein Laboratories. Investigators had been working  since then to determine its precise identity. In a statement, Scientific Protein Laboratories said a  consultant working for the Changzhou plant concluded the  contaminant is not linked to the plant’s production but likely  occurred earlier in the supply chain. Baxter, in a statement, agreed with the FDA’s finding of  over-sulfated chondroitin sulfate but also said the substance  contaminated the product before it reached SPL. FDA spokeswoman Siobhan DeLancey said the agency was still  investigating at what point the contamination occurred. Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers tentatively scheduled hearings on  the issue for April 15 and April 22. “This latest development underscores our concerns that FDA  does not have a robust enough presence overseas in conducting  inspections,” House of Representatives Energy and Commerce  Committee Chairman John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said in a  statement. Last month, Baxter recalled most of its U.S. supplies of  heparin, used in kidney dialysis as well as heart and other  surgeries to prevent blood clots. The FDA has received more than 785 reports of heparin  reactions, including 19 deaths in patients treated with some  brand of heparin. Baxter has said only four fatalities might be  related to its heparin and there is not enough information to  say the drug was the cause. The agency has told border inspectors to stop all shipments  of imported heparin intended for the U.S. market so they can be  tested for the contaminant. Germany also has ordered a recall of heparin made by  Rotexmedica after reports of allergic reactions there.","Health officials urge public to remain cautious as COVID-19 variants pose new threats

As the world grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a growing concern is emerging: the rise of new virus variants. Health officials are urging the public to remain cautious and vigilant, despite progress in vaccination efforts.

The emergence of several new variants, such as the Delta, Beta, and Gamma variants, has raised alarm bells among experts. These variants have shown increased transmissibility and the potential to evade immune responses, posing a significant threat to current efforts to control the spread of the virus.

One of the most concerning variants is the Delta variant, which was first identified in India. This highly contagious strain has quickly become one of the dominant variants worldwide. Studies have shown that it spreads faster than previous variants, making it imperative for individuals to continue following public health guidelines.

Dr. Emily Johnson, a leading epidemiologist, warns, ""While vaccines offer a high degree of protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death, they may not be as effective against certain variants. It is essential to maintain caution and adhere to preventive measures.""

Public health agencies are closely monitoring the situation and tracking the spread of these variants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended using genomic sequencing to identify and track specific variants. This data will help researchers analyze the behavior of these strains and guide public health strategies accordingly.

Amid these concerns, communities across the country have seen a decline in precautionary measures. Mask mandates have been lifted, and social distancing is becoming less prevalent in some areas. This premature relaxation of safety measures has health officials worried about potential consequences.

""We must continue practicing caution,"" says Dr. Sarah Adams, chief medical officer at a local hospital. ""A resurgence in cases could put a strain on our healthcare system, especially if the new variants become more prevalent.""

While vaccine rollout has been successful in many parts of the world, there are still significant portions of the population that remain unvaccinated. This poses a risk as new variants can easily spread among the unimmunized population, allowing them to mutate further.

To combat these challenges, experts emphasize the need for increased vaccination rates and continued adherence to safety measures. ""Vaccination is our strongest defense against COVID-19,"" explains Dr. Johnson. ""We must continue to promote vaccine education and access to ensure a higher level of protection.""

Health officials are also considering the possibility of booster shots to enhance immunity against new variants. Studies are ongoing to determine the effectiveness and necessity of additional doses, particularly for those who have already received the initial vaccine series.

In conclusion, the threat of COVID-19 variants demands continued caution from the public. Health officials stress the importance of following safety guidelines, even for those who are fully vaccinated. While progress has been made in controlling the pandemic, it is crucial not to let our guard down. Ongoing vigilance, coupled with increased vaccination rates and potential booster shots, will be essential in overcoming the challenges posed by these evolving variants.",true
5303,Lifetime movie ‘Flint’ dramatizes city’s water crisis.,"Mays, speaking to a TV critics’ meeting Friday, pointed to several bottles she had filled with her tap water and challenged the room to taste or even smell it. There were no immediate takers. The activist, who said the battle over water safety continues, is among the residents portrayed in Lifetime’s movie titled “Flint,” debuting Oct. 28. Mays is played by Marin Ireland, who co-stars with Betsy Brandt, Jill Scott and Queen Latifah. Executive producer Neil Meron said the film is intended to spotlight what happened in Flint, including how a united community and “the voice of the people” can force officials to act. Mays said there have been successes, including the outcome of a lawsuit to get half of the service lines replaced, although not the main lines or interior plumbing. “So one of the things we hope come out of this is to let people know it’s still not over. It’s not even close to over,” she said. The movie is intended to honor Flint victims by telling the story “that even in a poor, broken, poisoned town, we banded together, and we fought. We fought, and we win.” In 2014, a switch of Flint’s water source and failure to add corrosion-reducing phosphates allowed lead from old pipes to leach into the water. Elevated levels of lead, a neurotoxin, were detected in children, and 12 people died in a Legionnaires’ disease outbreak that experts suspect was linked to the improperly treated water. An ongoing investigation has led to charges against 13 current or former government officials, including two managers who Republican Gov. Rick Snyder appointed to run the city. Last January, state officials said Flint’s water system no longer has lead levels exceeding the federal limit. The announcement was promptly met by skepticism from some residents, Mays among them, maintaining the system still contains lead and continues to cause illness. Brandt, the former “Breaking Bad” star who’s a native of Bay City, Michigan, not far from Flint, said the person she portrays, LeeAnne Walters, was among those driven to act when authorities failed to heed complaints about their children becoming ill. “As a mom, it just shakes you, because there’s some things that we just should be able to count on,” Brandt said.","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it has become increasingly evident that misinformation and conspiracy theories are spreading at an alarming rate. These false narratives not only undermine public health efforts but also pose a significant threat to global recovery. It is imperative for individuals and communities to rely on accurate information from trusted sources to combat this infodemic effectively.

One of the most concerning aspects of this infodemic is the dissemination of conspiracy theories surrounding the origins of COVID-19. Some have incorrectly speculated that the virus was created in a laboratory as a biological weapon, while others suggest that it is a hoax designed to control the population. These baseless claims spread fear, confusion, and mistrust among the public, hindering efforts to control the virus and promote vaccination.

In response to these damaging narratives, various scientific studies and investigations have been conducted to understand the origins of the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently published a report stating that it is extremely unlikely that COVID-19 originated from a laboratory. This conclusion echoed the consensus among the majority of scientists and experts in the field.

Experts believe that the most plausible explanation is that the virus originated from zoonotic transmission, where it jumped from animals to humans, similar to previous coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS and MERS. Investigations into the exact source of the virus are ongoing, but evidence suggests a link between bats and COVID-19.

To address these conspiracy theories and debunk misinformation, public health authorities and reputable news outlets are collaborating to disseminate scientifically verified information about the virus and its origin. This includes providing accessible resources, fact-checking claims, and promoting public awareness campaigns.

However, combating misinformation requires more than just reliable information; it necessitates building trust within communities. This can be achieved through transparent communication and engaging with individuals to address their concerns and doubts. Governments and health organizations must actively listen to the public and acknowledge their uncertainties, using empathy and compassion to address fears and encourage vaccination.

Countering misinformation also calls for digital literacy and critical thinking skills. With the rapid proliferation of social media platforms, fact-checking becomes paramount. Individuals need to verify the credibility of sources and be mindful of biases before sharing or disseminating information. Fact-checking websites have emerged to help navigate the deluge of information, providing clarity amidst the abundance of falsehoods.

Moreover, holding social media platforms accountable is crucial in minimizing the spread of misinformation. These platforms must develop stricter policies to monitor and remove false claims promptly, while simultaneously promoting reliable sources and scientific consensus.

While governments, health organizations, and social media platforms play a significant role in combatting misinformation, individual responsibility remains paramount. Each person has a duty to ensure they are well-informed and to support evidence-based public health guidelines. By staying updated through trusted sources and encouraging friends and family to do the same, individuals can contribute to fighting the infodemic.

As the world grapples with the deadly consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial that we address the parallel crisis of misinformation. By promoting accurate information, building trust, and maintaining transparency, we can collectively overcome this infodemic and pave the way towards a healthier and more resilient future.",true
5838,Phoenix-area officials record 5 baby deaths from syphilis.,"The Arizona Republic reports the Maricopa County Department of Public Health counted 30 babies born with the disease in 2018. The department says the county’s rate of the disease has doubled over the last two years and is nearly 60 percent higher than the national average. Congenital syphilis is when an infected mother passes the disease to her baby during pregnancy. Rebecca Sunenshine, department medical director, says more men and women are getting the disease and not enough doctors are screening for it during pregnancy, leading to the increase in congenital syphilis. State law requires medical providers to test pregnant women for syphilis at the first prenatal visit. ___ Information from: The Arizona Republic, http://www.azcentral.com","Another COVID-19 Variant Detected in South Africa Raises Concerns over Vaccine Efficacy

As the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic continues, a new variant of the virus has been identified in South Africa, causing increased concern among health experts and raising questions about the efficacy of existing vaccines.

The new variant, dubbed B.1.351, was first detected in Nelson Mandela Bay in October 2020 and has since spread to other provinces in the country. Preliminary research suggests that it shares some similarities with the variant discovered in the United Kingdom, known as B.1.1.7, including higher transmissibility. However, what sets B.1.351 apart is its potential impact on vaccine effectiveness.

Scientists have found that certain mutations in the spike protein of the virus, which are present in both the UK and South African variants, could enable the virus to evade immune responses triggered by previous infection or vaccination. This means that individuals who have already been infected with COVID-19 or received the vaccine may not be fully protected against B.1.351.

While more research is needed to fully understand the implications of this new variant, preliminary studies have sparked concern among scientists and health authorities worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified B.1.351 as a ""variant of concern"" due to its potential effects on public health measures.

The emergence of B.1.351 has also prompted several countries to impose travel restrictions or mandatory quarantine periods for individuals traveling from South Africa. Governments are taking proactive measures to prevent the spread of the new variant within their borders while researchers continue to study its characteristics and potential impact.

The most pressing concern is how B.1.351 could affect current vaccine rollout efforts. Pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have developed highly effective vaccines against the original strain of the virus. However, there are growing concerns about whether these vaccines will provide adequate protection against new variants.

Initial findings from a small study published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated a reduced neutralization capacity of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the B.1.351 variant. Moderna has also reported that its vaccine generates fewer antibodies against this new strain, although they believe the vaccine should still provide enough protection to prevent severe illness.

Amidst this backdrop, scientists and vaccination experts are evaluating potential strategies to address new variants. Some suggest that vaccine manufacturers may need to update their formulations to target specific mutations found in B.1.351 and other emerging variants. This could resemble the annual flu vaccine model, where new strains are targeted each year.

However, the process of modifying and distributing vaccines takes time. Regulatory bodies would need to assess the safety and efficacy of updated versions before they can be administered to the population. In the meantime, global health authorities emphasize the continued importance of adhering to public health measures, such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and frequent hand hygiene.

Efforts are underway to expand genomic surveillance capabilities in countries worldwide, enabling the early detection of new variants and a rapid response to potential threats. The more data scientists gather on these variants, the better equipped they will be to develop effective countermeasures.

In conclusion, the emergence of the B.1.351 variant in South Africa has raised concerns over its potential impact on vaccine effectiveness. While further studies are needed, preliminary evidence suggests that current vaccines may not be as effective against this new variant. Scientists and health authorities are closely monitoring the situation and calling for continued adherence to preventive measures. The development of more adaptable vaccines and enhanced surveillance will be crucial in keeping pace with the ever-evolving nature of the virus.",true
7843,Online tool helps beachgoers avoid dirty waters.,"People swim and play in the Atlantic Ocean at Coney Island in the Brooklyn borough of New York July 21, 2011. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Last year was one of the worst on record in terms of bacterial pollution from human and animal waste, according to the nonprofit Natural Resource Defense Council’s (NRDC) 22nd annual survey of water quality at over 3,000 U.S. beaches. State and local beach officials reported the third-highest number of closings and advisory days in over 20 years. The impact of sewage and stormwater runoff on swimmers include diarrhea, pink eye, ear, nose and throat problems, respiratory ailments and several neurological disorders. To make the information easier to access, NRDC debuted a new online tool at www.nrdc.org/beaches that allows the public to search beaches by postal zip code. An application for mobile devices is also in the works. “Having that information when you’re planning the trip is far more important than when you’ve taken the trip,” said Steve Fleischli, Director of NRDC’s Water Program. The report shows how water quality levels vary significantly across the country. Delaware, not usually the first state that jumps to mind for many when thinking of fun in the sun, nonetheless had beaches reporting the lowest water contamination levels in the country, while Louisiana pollution has for consecutive years violated federal beach water standards. In California, the picture was mixed. Five beaches, including Newport and Huntington State Beaches in Orange County, for example, were awarded NRDC’s 5-star rating out of the dozen others, nationally, that received the top honor. However, eight of the state’s beaches appeared on a list of the nation’s 15 worst “Repeat Offenders” for violating public health standards. Evaluation criteria included monitoring frequency, indicators of beach water quality and whether the public was notified of contamination. Small children, senior citizens and people with weak immune systems are most at risk from exposure. NRDC has urged the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to modernize and raise water-quality standards, last set in 1986. The EPA is currently reviewing them. “We know that much of this filth is preventable and we can turn the tide against water pollution,” said NRDC attorney Jon Devine. NRDC also advocates investment in preventive efforts — from green roofs to porous pavement — that allow stormwater to filter back into the ground naturally rather than carrying waste from dirty streets into local beaches. More than 10 trillion gallons of untreated stormwater make their way every year into surface waters, according to EPA estimates. Over the next several months, Congress will debate whether to continue funding The Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act of 2000. It set national water quality monitoring and reporting standards and authorized $30 million dollars in funding. But lawmakers have only set aside about one-third of that amount in any fiscal year. Earlier this year, citing a “difficult financial climate,” the EPA recommended cuts to the near $10 million in annual grants it gives to states to support their test and monitoring procedures. “People are talking about billions of dollars in the budget and when you’re talking about $10 million dollars, it seems like a rounding error,” NRDC’s Fleischli said. “But if you make this kind of budget cut it’s going to have significant ramifications for the public and the information that the public has.”","CDC Recommends Boosters for Fully Vaccinated Individuals

In response to the emerging data on waning immunity against COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued new guidance recommending booster shots for fully vaccinated individuals. This move aims to further enhance protection against the Delta variant and possibly other future variants.

Recent studies have shown that although the current vaccines provide a robust defense against severe illness and hospitalization, their effectiveness in preventing symptomatic infection decreases over time. The CDC's advisory committee reviewed available evidence, taking into account breakthrough infections and the potential impact of reduced vaccine efficacy on public health.

The recommendation calls for individuals who completed their vaccination course with either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines to receive a booster shot eight months after their second dose. The booster should be the same brand as the original vaccination series. People who initially received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are also advised to get a booster, but the specific timing remains under consideration, pending further data.

Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC Director, emphasized the importance of boosting immunity as a proactive measure against the virus. She highlighted the need to act swiftly to prevent a surge in cases that could overwhelm healthcare systems. ""We need to stay ahead of this virus and not chase it,"" she said during a press briefing. 

Furthermore, Dr. Walensky underscored the significance of robust protection against COVID-19 to ensure the reopening and functioning of schools, businesses, and daily life without interruptions. Booster shots, she stressed, are a crucial tool to accomplish this objective.

To support its recommendation, the CDC cited real-world data from multiple observational studies showcasing the booster's effectiveness in heightening immune response against the virus. These studies demonstrated increased levels of neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses post-booster. Additionally, a preliminary analysis conducted by the CDC conveyed evidence of declining vaccine efficiency six months after full immunization, especially among older adults.

While this recommendation has been met with support from public health experts, concerns have also been raised. Some argue that booster shots should be prioritized for vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and immunocompromised individuals, considering their increased risk of severe disease. Others highlight the significance of global vaccine equity and argue that additional doses for fully vaccinated individuals in wealthy nations may exacerbate supply shortages in low-income countries.

The Biden administration has acknowledged these concerns and pledged to help provide vaccines globally while ensuring sufficient supply domestically. In early September, the White House announced plans to make booster shots available to all eligible individuals, alongside increasing efforts to donate more doses to other countries. The ultimate goal is to protect both the domestic population and contribute to global vaccination efforts simultaneously.

As the booster rollout commences, vaccine providers are preparing to accommodate an influx in demand. Health departments and providers will aim to reach eligible individuals promptly and efficiently, following CDC guidelines. To ensure easy access to boosters, vaccination sites, pharmacies, and healthcare providers are encouraged to extend their hours and expand capacity.

In conclusion, the CDC's endorsement of booster shots for fully vaccinated individuals marks a significant step in ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19. The recommendation aims to maximize protection against the Delta variant, prevent future surges, and ultimately restore normalcy to everyday life. As distribution begins, it is crucial to prioritize equitable access and global vaccination initiatives to address the persisting pandemic on a broader scale.",true
1623,Venom experts say global snake bite death tolls 'grossly underestimated'.,"In a joint statement after a five-day conference in Britain, the international experts said snake bites kill more people than all other so-called Neglected Tropical Diseases combined, yet get little attention or funding from the World Health Organisation (WHO) or from governments. Citing new evidence from a study in India and Bangladesh, the experts said around 46,000 people died annually of snake bites in India, plus another 6,000 in Bangladesh. The WHO estimates the annual death toll in India from snake bites is 10,000. “Snake bite ... is almost completely ignored and grossly underestimated,” said Alan Harvey, head of the International Society of Toxinology, who led the meeting. “WHO and governments need to ... rank snake bite where it belongs — as a very real public health and medical concern which needs funding, training and focus.”  Bites from snakes such as cobras, mambas and vipers mainly affect people living in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia with scant health facilities nearby. Antivenom treatment can cost between $250 and $500, the experts said, meaning many victims either seek no treatment at all or go to local witch doctors or herbalists. Despite high death rates, the WHO in 2013 downgraded snake bite to a “neglected condition” with no formal program on how to address it as a health threat, the experts said. The specialists also warned that antivenom stocks are running “dangerously low” in many risk areas and said there is a “real crisis in the quantity and quality of antivenoms in rural areas, where they are needed most”. Even where antivenom stocks are good and of high quality, there is often a shortage of medical staff trained in how to administer them safely or effectively.","The Importance of COVID-19 Vaccination Reaches New Heights

Amid the ongoing battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, the significance of widespread vaccination has reached new heights. With new variants emerging and cases surging in many parts of the world, health experts are emphasizing the importance of getting vaccinated to curb the spread of the virus and save lives.

As vaccination campaigns continue to roll out worldwide, countries are witnessing the positive impact vaccines have on reducing severe illness and hospitalizations. Multiple studies have shown that authorized COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe symptoms and complications, including hospitalization and death.

One study conducted by researchers at a prominent medical institution examined the impact of COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers. The findings revealed that fully vaccinated individuals had lower chances of contracting the virus compared to those who were unvaccinated. Moreover, in the rare event that a vaccinated individual did contract the virus, their symptoms were milder, and hospitalizations were significantly reduced.

Furthermore, another study analyzed the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe illness and hospitalization among older adults. The results indicated that vaccinated individuals above the age of 65 had a much lower risk of developing severe symptoms or requiring hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection. This demonstrates the crucial role vaccinations play in protecting vulnerable populations from the worst outcomes of the virus.

Recent data from countries with high vaccination rates provide additional evidence for the importance of widespread immunization. These regions have witnessed a decline in the number of ICU admissions and deaths attributed to COVID-19. This serves as a testament to the efficacy of vaccines in preventing severe disease and potentially breaking the chain of transmission within communities.

Moreover, as various COVID-19 variants continue to emerge, health experts highlight the urgency of vaccination in tackling these evolving threats. The Delta variant, for instance, has shown to be more transmissible than previous strains of the virus and is causing surges in infections globally. However, recent studies indicate that authorized vaccines still provide a significant level of protection against this variant, especially preventing severe illness and hospitalizations.

Encouragingly, vaccination efforts have been ramping up in many countries, resulting in substantial progress worldwide. Governments are investing in educational campaigns, vaccine distribution, and accessibility initiatives to ensure that as many people as possible receive their immunizations.

However, challenges remain. Vaccine hesitancy is an obstacle that authorities around the world are addressing. Misinformation and concerns over side effects have fueled hesitancy among some individuals, causing them to delay or refuse vaccination. To combat this, extensive efforts are being made to provide accurate information about vaccine safety and efficacy through public health campaigns and community engagement.

In conclusion, the importance of COVID-19 vaccination cannot be emphasized enough. Scientific evidence continues to demonstrate the effectiveness of authorized vaccines in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death. As new variants emerge, getting vaccinated becomes even more crucial in curbing transmission and protecting vulnerable populations. Governments and health organizations must work together to combat vaccine hesitancy and ensure that everyone has access to accurate information and vaccine availability. The collective effort to promote vaccination will undoubtedly contribute to a safer future for all.",true
3394,Massachusetts high court delays hearing on vaping ban suit.,"The state Supreme Judicial Court said in an order released Friday that Monday’s planned court hearing in an appeal brought by the Vapor Technology Association will be postponed until further notice. The court is awaiting the results of new vaping regulations the state plans to issue next week before making a decision on the case. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker last week signed into law new restrictions on flavored tobacco and vaping products and promised to rescind the state’s emergency ban of the sale of all vaping products. Baker said the state’s Public Health Council will meet Wednesday to adopt new regulations as part of the new state law, at which point he’ll lift the emergency ban. The ban was imposed in September and set to last until the end of December. Neighboring Rhode Island also has a temporary ban on the sale of flavored vaping products. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo signed an executive order in September and the health department issued emergency regulations Oct. 4 to implement a four-month ban, with an optional two-month extension. Rhode Island lawmakers have said they’ll address vaping in the next legislative session, which begins in January. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut is trying to figure out how to regulate vaping, after expressing an interest in banning flavored vaping products. A new law recently took effect in Connecticut that increased the age to 21 for someone to purchase vaping products.","COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Lagging Behind in Rural Communities

Amidst the ongoing battle against COVID-19, vaccination rates in rural communities across the nation have become a cause for concern. Despite the availability and effectiveness of vaccines, these areas continue to fall behind in achieving desired immunization levels. As the highly contagious Delta variant spreads across the country, public health officials are intensifying efforts to address this disparity and ensure that rural communities receive adequate protection.

Factors contributing to the lower vaccination rates in rural areas are multifaceted. Limited access to healthcare facilities and vaccine distribution centers has been a significant hurdle for many residents. The distances individuals need to travel, combined with the absence of reliable transportation options, pose challenges for those interested in getting vaccinated. Additionally, a scarcity of medical professionals, including nurses and doctors who can administer the shots, exacerbates the problem. 

Misinformation and hesitancy also play a role in impeding vaccine uptake. Conspiracy theories and false claims circulating on social media platforms have led to vaccine skepticism among some rural residents. This mistrust is fueled by the lack of targeted education campaigns and outreach efforts that could debunk myths and allay fears. Addressing misinformation and building trust in the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines are crucial steps towards improving vaccination rates in these communities.

To bridge the vaccination gap, federal and state governments, in collaboration with public health agencies, are implementing various strategies. Mobile vaccination clinics have been dispatched to rural areas, bringing vaccines directly to the doorstep of communities. By eliminating the transportation barrier, these mobile units aim to make vaccinations more accessible. Local health departments have also worked tirelessly to provide vaccination information through local newspapers, radio stations, and community meetings, ensuring accurate and up-to-date knowledge reaches rural residents.

Community engagement efforts are proving to be effective in encouraging vaccination within these regions. Grassroots organizations, religious leaders, and trusted members of the community are serving as influential voices, delivering accurate information and addressing concerns. Their efforts have helped dispel myths surrounding vaccine safety and efficacy, leading to increased acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.

Furthermore, offering incentives has become a popular method to boost vaccination uptake. Some rural areas have implemented programs that offer gift cards, discounts at local stores, or even chances to win cash prizes for those who get vaccinated. These initiatives serve not only as motivators but also foster a sense of community solidarity in the fight against the virus.

Despite these proactive measures, challenges persist. Resolving the logistical barriers of geography and transportation will require careful planning and resource allocation. State governments must ensure that rural communities are equipped with sufficient healthcare infrastructure, including vaccination centers, medical personnel, and reliable access to essential services.

Rural populations may also benefit from customized campaigns tailored to their unique characteristics and needs. Identifying influential figures within these communities and partnering with local organizations can enable targeted messaging that resonates more effectively. Culturally sensitive educational materials that address specific concerns and debunk misconceptions would help build trust and drive up vaccination rates.

As the pandemic continues to threaten our collective wellbeing, it is imperative to leave no one behind. By prioritizing rural communities and implementing tailored strategies, public health officials can bridge the vaccination gap and protect all individuals, irrespective of their location. Ultimately, achieving higher vaccination rates in these regions will contribute significantly to curbing the spread of COVID-19 and moving towards a healthier, more resilient nation.",true
7802,International campaigners urge UK to allow 'three-parent' IVF babies.,"In an open letter ahead of a parliamentary vote scheduled for Tuesday, charities and advocacy groups said the opportunity “offers families the first glimmer of hope that they might be able to have a baby that will live without pain and suffering.”  The technique under debate is known as mitochondrial donation and is often referred to as three-parent in vitro fertilization (IVF) because the offspring would have genes from a mother, a father and from a female donor. The process, still only at the research stage in Britain and the United States, involves intervening in the fertilization process to remove faulty mitochondrial DNA, which can cause inherited conditions such as fatal heart problems, liver failure, brain disorders, blindness and muscular dystrophy. It is feared by critics who say it effectively allows “designer babies” because it would involve implanting genetically modified embryos into women. Britain last February set out draft legislation that, if passed, would make it the first country to allow the technique. In their letter, groups including the U.S.-based United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation, the Australian Mitochondrial Disease Foundation and groups from France, Germany, Britain and Spain, described mitochondrial disease as “unimaginably cruel”. “It strips our children of the skills they have learned, inflicts pain that cannot be managed and tires their organs one by one until their little bodies cannot go on any more,” they wrote. They said they were aware “that no novel medical procedure is without risk”, but had “absolute confidence” in scientific panels that have examined the technique. The issue of mitochondrial donation has been scrutinized by several expert panels in Britain, including the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. Many scientists and medics have welcomed the government’s decision to push ahead. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said it would “allow the law to catch up with public and scientific opinion”. “Parents who know what it means to care for a sick and suffering child with mitochondrial disease are the people best placed to decide ... whether mitochondrial donation is right for them,” he said. “It is time to allow them to make that choice.”","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in mental health issues among the general population. The summary of this article highlights the alarming rise in mental health problems during these challenging times.

As the coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, the impact on public health goes beyond physical illness. People are facing unprecedented levels of anxiety, stress, and depression due to the fear of contracting the virus, financial insecurity, and the overall uncertainty that the pandemic has brought upon us.

Various studies and reports have indicated a concerning increase in mental health issues amidst the ongoing crisis. A recent survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed that symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder have been three times higher compared to pre-pandemic levels.

The prolonged isolation caused by lockdown measures has severely affected individuals' mental well-being. Humans are social beings, and the lack of face-to-face interactions and physical touch has taken an immense toll on their mental health. Many people, especially those living alone, have reported feelings of loneliness and sadness, leading to a decline in their overall emotional well-being.

Furthermore, the economic consequences of the pandemic have added another layer of stress and anxiety. Millions of people have lost their jobs or faced significant pay cuts, causing financial instability and worry about basic necessities. This constant financial strain has further fueled mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety.

In addition to the general population, healthcare workers and frontline workers have been particularly impacted by the pandemic's mental health toll. These heroes have tirelessly worked round-the-clock, risking their lives to save others. Witnessing death and suffering on a daily basis has left many healthcare professionals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and burnout. The high demand for mental health services has overwhelmed resources and left many struggling to find the support they desperately need.

Awareness about mental health has been critical during these challenging times. Governments and organizations have acknowledged the importance of mental well-being and have taken steps to provide adequate support. Many helplines, online therapy platforms, and mental health resources have been made available to those in need.

It is crucial for society to prioritize mental health as much as physical health, as the two are deeply interconnected. Governments and institutions must invest in mental health services and ensure accessibility for all individuals, including marginalized communities who may face additional challenges.

Furthermore, individuals should take proactive steps to safeguard their mental health. Engaging in regular exercise, practicing relaxation techniques, maintaining a routine, and staying connected with loved ones through virtual means can contribute positively to mental well-being.

As we navigate through these uncertain times, it is of utmost importance to address the mental health crisis alongside the physical health crisis posed by COVID-19. The collective effort of individuals, communities, and governments is required to mitigate the long-term impact on mental health and prevent further exacerbation of the current situation.

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in mental health problems. The fear, isolation, and financial strain resulting from the crisis have taken a toll on individuals' mental well-being. Governments, organizations, and individuals must prioritize mental health and provide adequate support to combat this growing crisis.",true
2742,Furiex irritable bowel syndrome drug succeeds in large trials.,"Furiex said it would apply by mid-year for U.S. approval of the drug, eluxadoline, to treat diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-d), a debilitating bowel disorder that affects about 28 million people in the United States and major European markets. Furiex said it expected to seek European approval in early 2015. The company’s shares rose as much as 165 percent to $121.97, valuing it at about $1.3 billion. “We believe that there are a lot of patients out there who need this drug. There is a huge unmet need,” Furiex Chief Medical Officer June Almenoff said in a telephone interview. Currently approved drugs for IBS address constipation associated with the disorder, but there are few options for diarrhea predominant IBS. Furiex founder and chairman Fred Eshelman said he believes the drug has the potential for blockbuster sales, which he defined as annual sales of between $750 million and $1 billion. Eluxadoline was tested at two doses against a placebo over the course of 12 weeks to meet requirements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and for 26 weeks for European health regulators, in Phase III studies involving 2,428 patients, Furiex said. For the combined goal of improvement in abdominal pain and stool consistency for at least half the days in the study, eluxadoline achieved a statistically significant improvement at the 100 milligram and 75 mg doses through 12 weeks in both studies. On the 26-week measure, the higher dose succeeded in both studies but the lower dose missed statistical significance in one of the two trials, according to initial results released by the company. The success appeared to be driven by the percentage of patients reporting improvements in diarrhea, which ranged from 30 percent to 37 percent versus 22 percent and 20.9 percent for the placebo groups. When the composite goal was broken into its two components, researchers found a numerical improvement in pain response rates that did not achieve statistical significance. The drug appeared to be safe and well-tolerated in both studies, Furiex said. The most commonly reported side effects were constipation and nausea. The company plans to present a far more detailed analysis of the late stage studies at an upcoming medical meeting. “We’re very excited about the path ahead and about how this can transform patients’ lives,” Almenoff said. Furiex shares were up 142 percent at $110.99 in early trading on the Nasdaq.","COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Rise as Public Health Efforts Intensify

A new variant of the coronavirus, named B.1.351, has been detected in South Africa, prompting concerns among health officials and experts worldwide. This highly transmissible strain is raising questions about the effectiveness of current vaccines and the potential for increased infection rates.

The discovery of the B.1.351 variant occurred during routine genomic surveillance in South Africa and was first announced by the country's health department. The variant carries several mutations in the spike protein, which is the target for most COVID-19 vaccines currently available. These mutations have raised concerns about their impact on the efficacy of existing vaccines, potentially leading to a need for booster shots or modified vaccine formulations.

Preliminary research suggests that the B.1.351 variant may be more contagious than previous strains of the virus. Experts are particularly worried about its potential to evade immune responses, making it more difficult for antibodies developed through natural infection or vaccination to recognize and neutralize the virus. This raises concerns that prior immunity, either from natural infection or vaccination, may offer less protection against this variant.

Although the B.1.351 variant was initially detected in South Africa, it has since spread to other countries, including the United States, Australia, and several European nations. This highlights the global interconnectedness of the pandemic and reinforces the importance of international cooperation in identifying and monitoring emerging variants.

While further studies are needed to fully understand the implications of the B.1.351 variant, there is currently no evidence to suggest that it causes more severe illness or an increased risk of death. However, its heightened transmissibility raises the possibility of a surge in infections, potentially overwhelming healthcare systems already strained by the pandemic.

Concerns regarding the B.1.351 variant have amplified calls for accelerated vaccine distribution campaigns worldwide. Scientists are working diligently to evaluate the variant's susceptibility to existing vaccines and develop strategies to address any potential gaps in protection. Pharmaceutical companies have already begun investigating the need for booster shots or adapted vaccine formulations to effectively target this new variant.

Health officials emphasize that existing public health measures, such as social distancing, wearing masks, and practicing good hand hygiene, remain critical in controlling the spread of all COVID-19 variants. These measures have proven effective in preventing infection with the original strain of the virus and are expected to be similarly effective against B.1.351 due to the shared mode of transmission.

In addition to vaccinations and preventive measures, genomic surveillance remains a key element in identifying emerging variants and implementing targeted mitigation strategies. Countries around the world are enhancing their surveillance efforts to detect and track new strains, which will help inform public health responses and guide the development of future vaccines and treatments.

As the global fight against COVID-19 continues, experts stress the importance of remaining vigilant and adaptable in the face of evolving variants. While the discovery of the B.1.351 variant raises concerns, it also underscores the necessity of ongoing research and collaboration to stay ahead of the virus and protect public health.",true
3149,"Outdated, dangerous childbirth practices persist in Europe.","Masson said her pleas to stop were ignored at the Barcelona hospital where she delivered two years ago, and she later complained to authorities. The hospital said doctors took “appropriate measures” during her delivery. “I thought I was going to die,” she said. “For one month after, my belly was blue and purple.”    The technique is known as the Kristeller maneuver and was first described in an 1867 German textbook. It is sometimes used during the second stage of labor to assist delivery and avoid a cesarean section when complications arise. But many doctors in developed countries say they have stopped using it because of the potential for broken bones, organ damage, and other complications. The World Health Organization does not recommend the technique. Yet the procedure is still commonly performed in many European countries, highlighting how once-accepted practices can persist even long after they’re considered to be unnecessary or even dangerous. Europe has some of the world’s lowest maternal and infant death rates, and assertions of mistreatment during childbirth are more common in Africa, Asia and Latin America. But the Kristeller maneuver and some other medical practices related to childbirth have come under increasing scrutiny in Europe, including complaints about inadequate anesthesia, surgical incisions during vaginal births and failure to seek patient consent for certain procedures. “Depending on the act, these practices rise to the level of a human rights violation,” said Mindy Roseman, director of a global justice and women’s rights program at Yale Law School. “Not obtaining consent from women for medical procedures, not providing pain relief or doing something that’s not scientifically justified, that is simply not the standard of care and it’s troubling wherever that occurs.” Last year, Croatian lawmaker Ivana Nincevic Lesandric drew attention to the anesthesia issue when she complained to Parliament she did not receive any for an emergency procedure after a miscarriage. “I don’t think I’ve ever been in (a) much more painful situation in my life,” Lesandric said. In response, the Speaker of the House chastised Lesandric for speaking over her allotted time and for publicly sharing such intimate details, saying it put him in an awkward position. The Ministry of Health, while not  directly  commenting on her case, said doctors typically use a local anesthetic for such procedures. Officials suggested there may have been a “misunderstanding” on Lesandric’s part regarding the type of anesthesia she received. Dr. Frederick Mercier, chair of obstetrics for the European Society of Anesthesiology, said general anesthesia is “most often used” in procedures like the one Lesandric had. He said local anesthesia isn’t used because “it is less effective.” In the days following her speech to Parliament, a childbirth advocacy group asked for and received hundreds of complaints about medical care from Croatian women. Three U.N. human rights experts, including two from Croatia, later said the responses “showed a pattern of abuse and violence against women undertaking medical procedures.”  “I see it as another #MeToo campaign where certain issues were not being seen as human rights violations and were being tolerated,” said Ivana Radacic, a Croatian who sits on a panel for the U.N.’s Human Rights Council. In submissions for a U.N. report presented in October, several European countries or government-appointed experts acknowledged lapses in how informed consent from women during childbirth was obtained. The Czech Republic wrote that women were sometimes given documents to sign “without any explanation or information on the nature or reason for the procedure.”  Dr. Ozge Tuncalp, a maternal and reproductive health care expert at WHO, said the U.N. health agency has noted increasing reports of mistreatment by women seeking health care in Europe. “Some of these things have become common practice and people think this is what they’re supposed to do, so it is very difficult to undo,” she said. The WHO says a once common procedure — a surgical incision to enlarge the vagina during childbirth and prevent tears — should not be used in more than about 10% of women and that consent should be mandatory. Yet government figures show rates range from 30% to more than 90% in countries including the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Romania. In France, a 2018 government report estimated that half of women who had the incision weren’t told beforehand. In Italy, one survey estimated 61% of women did not consent. Marta Busquets, a Spanish lawyer, said she asked the two midwives handling her delivery not to make the incision, but that they cut her anyway. “I felt really humiliated, but it’s my word against theirs,” she said. The hospital would not comment on her case, but said the procedure should not be performed routinely and that it obtains verbal consent when it is performed. In October, the Council of Europe passed a resolution on “obstetrical and gynecological violence.” Among other recommendations, it called on European member countries to implement laws on informed consent and to create specific reporting and complaint mechanisms, including sanctions for mistreatment. How often the Kristeller maneuver is used isn’t clear since it often isn’t included in medical records. Doctors, nurses and midwives in countries including Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Spain told The Associated Press they see it used on a weekly, if not daily, basis. A French government report last year estimated it was used in about 22% of births. In Italy, researchers concluded in a 2018 study that the Kristeller technique was documented in medical records only in about 10% of cases. “The evidence says it’s not helpful, it’s actually harmful,” said the WHO’s Tuncalp. “The fact that so many women are getting an intervention that both national and international guidance recommend against, is very worrying.” The technique is prohibited in the U.K., according to Dr. Patrick O’Brien, of Britain’s Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists. In the United States, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said they had no guidelines on the Kristeller maneuver because it is not recommended. “I can’t think of any reason you would resort to this,” said O’Brien. Dr. Ligita Jokubkiene of Sweden said she thinks it is still used because many doctors and midwives aren’t aware of the dangers. She learned it in medical school but no longer performs it herself. “If the woman was having bad contractions or if we wanted the delivery to go a bit quicker, it was easier to press on the woman and try to get the baby out fast,” she said. Spain’s Ministry of Health instructed health professionals to stop using it in its 2007 guidelines. But in a 2016 evaluation, government officials found it was still being done in about a quarter of women having vaginal births. Massons and her husband, Toni, remain troubled by the birth of their son Jaume, now 2. Massons was told the technique was needed because her labor had slowed, and because the baby was in a worrying position. In a letter to Massons that she shared with the AP, Dr. Miquel Gomez, medical director of the private Barcelona hospital where Massons gave birth, wrote that doctors took “appropriate measures.”  The ombudsman for the Catalonia region noted the Kristeller technique was “discouraged” but not legally banned. WHO’s Tuncalp said that transforming medical care — and not just guidelines — is very difficult. “It can take generations of doctors to actually change practices in the labor ward,” she said.","Evidence Mounts for the Efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccines in Preventing Severe Illness and Death

As the world battles the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, new evidence continues to emerge regarding the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing severe illness and death. With vaccination campaigns in full swing across the globe, nations are closely monitoring the impact of immunization on public health. The data collected so far provides growing confidence that COVID-19 vaccines are a powerful tool in curbing the devastation caused by the virus.

A recent study conducted by renowned researchers and published in a leading medical journal found that fully vaccinated individuals have a significantly reduced risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. The study analyzed real-world data from various countries and encompassed a large sample size of vaccinated individuals. It demonstrated that the vaccines not only offer high levels of protection against infection but also provide a robust defense against severe disease outcomes.

Chief among the findings was a stark reduction in hospitalizations among vaccinated individuals who contracted COVID-19 compared to their unvaccinated counterparts. The study showed that most hospitalizations occurred among those who remained unvaccinated, highlighting the importance of widespread vaccination campaigns to alleviate strains on healthcare systems. These results further emphasize the crucial role vaccines play in preventing severe illness and reducing the burden on hospitals and medical professionals.

Additionally, mounting evidence suggests that certain COVID-19 variants, which have raised concerns in recent months, are also effectively neutralized by the vaccines. Several studies have shown that fully vaccinated individuals maintain a strong immune response against new variants of the virus, including the highly transmissible Delta variant. While breakthrough infections can occur, vaccinated individuals are less likely to require hospitalization or experience severe clinical outcomes compared to those who are unvaccinated.

The promising data surrounding vaccine efficacy is now being reflected in real-world scenarios. Countries with high vaccination rates have witnessed a considerable decline in severe illness and deaths, indicating that the vaccines are delivering on their promise. In contrast, regions with low vaccine coverage continue to face significant challenges in containing the virus, as their populations remain vulnerable to severe outcomes.

Moreover, experts argue that vaccination remains a vital part of the strategy to control the pandemic, particularly as the Delta variant continues to spread rapidly. Ensuring high vaccination rates can contribute to achieving herd immunity, protecting those who are unable to receive the vaccine and curbing further transmission of the virus. Health authorities around the world encourage individuals who have not yet been vaccinated to prioritize immunization to safeguard themselves and the broader community.

Nevertheless, despite the growing evidence of vaccine effectiveness, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation persist as barriers to achieving widespread immunization. Misleading claims about serious side effects or doubts surrounding the efficacy of vaccines continue to circulate, fueling vaccine skepticism among some populations. This hesitancy remains a concern for public health officials, who emphasize the importance of accurate information campaigns to address misconceptions and promote confidence in vaccines.

As research continues to shed light on the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines, it is clear that vaccination is an essential weapon in the fight against the pandemic. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the notion that vaccines significantly reduce the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19, while also providing protection against emerging variants. To protect both individual and public health, governments and health organizations must work together to ensure the equitable distribution and access to vaccines, accompanied by robust communication efforts to counter vaccine hesitancy.

The road to ending the pandemic lies in harnessing the power of vaccines, offering hope that a safer future is within reach.",true
4059,Vermonter dies of rare complication of Lyme disease.,"The state says it’s the first reported death from Lyme carditis in Vermont. Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine says while Lyme disease is increasingly common in Vermont, Lyme carditis is very rare. He says about 1 percent of all Lyme disease cases reported nationally to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention experience Lyme carditis. Levine says the rare condition happens when bacteria that cause Lyme disease gets into the tissues of the heart, where it can interfere with the movement of electrical signals between the heart’s chambers. Levine says while tick-borne diseases can cause serious illness, Lyme disease, including Lyme carditis, is treatable.","Scientists Discover New Potential Treatment for COVID-19

Researchers across the globe have made a groundbreaking discovery that could potentially revolutionize the treatment of COVID-19. In a recent study published in the prestigious medical journal, researchers revealed their findings on a potential novel therapy for the deadly virus.

Current COVID-19 treatments primarily focus on managing symptoms and supporting patients until their immune systems can effectively fight off the virus. However, this newly identified therapy aims to directly target the replication process of the virus itself, offering hope for a more effective treatment and improved patient outcomes.

The experimental therapy utilizes a combination of antiviral drugs that have been used individually for other diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis C. Scientists theorized that by combining these drugs, they would be able to disrupt the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

In laboratory experiments, the researchers exposed infected cells to the combination therapy and observed significant reductions in viral replication. The results showed that the therapy was highly effective at inhibiting the virus and preventing its spread within the cells.

Encouraged by these promising findings, the researchers quickly moved on to animal trials. When mice with COVID-19-like symptoms were treated with the combination therapy, they displayed remarkable improvements in their overall health. The therapy not only reduced viral loads but also alleviated lung inflammation associated with severe cases of the disease.

Furthermore, the experimental therapy showed potential in preventing the transmission of the virus. When healthy mice were given the treatment before exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the therapy acted as a preventive measure, effectively blocking the virus from infecting the animals.

While this breakthrough therapy is certainly exciting news in the fight against COVID-19, experts caution that further research is necessary before it can be considered a viable treatment option for humans. Clinical trials involving human participants are still required to determine the safety and effectiveness of the therapy.

However, if proven successful, this therapy could potentially offer several advantages over existing treatments. Unlike many current antiviral drugs, the combination therapy has shown a broader spectrum of activity against different strains of the virus. This could be particularly significant as new variants continue to emerge.

The researchers are now working diligently to translate their findings into clinical trials, and they hope to begin testing the therapy on human patients in the coming months. If these trials prove successful, it could mark a major breakthrough in the treatment of COVID-19, offering hope for millions of people worldwide who have been affected by the ongoing pandemic.

In the meantime, experts emphasize the importance of continuing to follow preventive measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and vaccination. These are still the most effective ways to reduce the spread of the virus and protect ourselves and our communities.

As the global scientific community remains committed to advancing knowledge and finding solutions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, this new potential treatment brings a renewed sense of optimism. The tireless efforts of researchers, combined with innovative therapies like this one, may finally lead us toward a brighter future where we can overcome the challenges posed by the virus.",true
7345,Minnesota eases restrictions; honors victims of COVID-19.,"While restrictions ease, the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise. The Minnesota Department of Health on Friday reported 20 more COVID-19 deaths, raising Minnesota’s death toll to 683, and a new one-day high of 808 confirmed cases, raising the total count to 14,240, which officials say is a big understatement of total infections. The state’s infectious disease director, Kris Ehresmann, told reporters in the department’s daily briefing that it’s important with the state’s stay-at-home order expiring Monday and some businesses reopening to continue to follow social distancing guidelines. “We want you to enjoy the weather, we want you to look forward to Monday, but we want you to stay 6 feet apart, wear a cloth mask when you’re outside of your home, and don’t gather in groups any larger than 10,” she said. Gov. Tim Walz ordered that flags at state and federal buildings in Minnesota to be flown at half-staff from sunrise to sunset on Tuesday and on the 19th of every month through 2020 “to remember, mourn, and honor lives lost due to COVID-19.” He encouraged individuals, businesses, and other organizations to join in. “I think this is a wonderful way to remind us that these are not just numbers,” Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm told reporters as she reviewed the health department’s updated statistics. “Going through these numbers every day, one can almost become numb to the fact that they represent — every one of them — a loved one and a family member and a neighbor.”  Young drivers will once again be able to take their license tests and other residents will once again be able to access most driver and vehicle services, the Department of Public Safety announced. The department is opening 16 exam stations statewide beginning Tuesday and resuming standard road tests May 26, with priority going to those who had their appointments canceled during the stay-at-home, though it’s not taking new appointments yet. People whose driver’s licenses or official state ID cards expired during the shutdown will now be able to renew them. But the department said the stations will look different because of measures to protect customers and staff. While campgrounds at Minnesota state parks remain closed, the federal Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness will open Monday for both day and overnight use. “We ask that visitors please continue to follow local, state and federal guidelines on staying safe and practice good hygiene and social distancing wherever they choose to visit,” Connie Cummins, supervisor of the Superior National Forest, said in a statement. Other parts of the Superior and Chippewa National Forests in northern Minnesota will also open Monday for overnight camping at dispersed sites. Voyageurs National Park will reopen to overnight camping and houseboat mooring on Monday, thought visitors centers will remain closed, so visitors must print their permits at home.","New COVID-19 Variants Pose Concerns for Global Health 

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, new variants of the virus have emerged, causing concern among global health officials. These variants, most notably the Delta variant and the Lambda variant, are believed to be more transmissible and potentially more resistant to current vaccines. The rise of these variants calls for heightened vigilance and a reevaluation of public health measures.

The Delta variant, first identified in India, has quickly become the dominant strain in several countries including the United Kingdom and the United States. Public health experts warn that this variant is up to 60% more transmissible than previous strains, leading to a significant increase in cases. Data suggests that it may also cause more severe illness and lead to higher hospitalization rates.

Several studies have shown that the current vaccines offer high levels of protection against the Delta variant, particularly after two doses. However, concerns remain about the effectiveness of a single dose, as it may provide only limited protection. As a result, health authorities are urging individuals to complete their vaccination series to ensure maximum immunity against the Delta variant and other emerging strains.

While the Delta variant poses immediate challenges, the Lambda variant has also garnered attention. Originating in Peru, this variant has now spread to at least 29 countries. Although it is not yet classified as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization, preliminary research indicates that it could be more resistant to antibodies generated by previous infections or vaccinations.

Scientists are actively studying the Lambda variant to determine its rate of transmission and potential impact on vaccine efficacy. This underscores the urgency for continued genomic surveillance to identify and monitor emerging variants across the globe.

To address the threat posed by these new variants, governments and public health agencies must adapt their strategies. Countries with low vaccination rates are particularly vulnerable and should prioritize increasing access to vaccines and promoting vaccine uptake. In addition, ongoing testing and contact tracing efforts are crucial to identify and isolate cases promptly, slowing the spread of variants within communities.

It is important to note that existing public health measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and hand hygiene remain effective against these variants. While vaccines are a vital tool in controlling the pandemic, a comprehensive approach that combines vaccination with other preventive measures is essential.

Furthermore, global collaboration is crucial in managing the spread of these variants. Countries must share data and scientific findings to stay informed about emerging threats and develop coordinated responses. Vaccine equity is also imperative, as unequal access to vaccines can perpetuate the emergence of new variants and prolong the pandemic on a global scale.

In conclusion, the rise of new COVID-19 variants, including the Delta and Lambda variants, pose significant challenges to public health. These variants have demonstrated increased transmissibility and potential resistance to current vaccines. Heightened vigilance, increased vaccine uptake, continued testing, and global cooperation are vital in addressing this evolving situation. By adapting strategies and maintaining precautionary measures, we can work collectively to mitigate the impact of these variants and bring an end to the ongoing pandemic.",true
1656,EU drug agency sees no U.S.-like cannabis legalization moves.,"He did not spell out why he expected no corresponding EU moves. But in a statement, his agency said a key finding in its latest annual report was a “marked rise in the potency and purity of Europe’s most commonly used illicit drugs, fuelling concerns for the health of users who, wittingly or unwittingly, may be consuming stronger products”. It also pointed out an increase in the numbers of cannabis-related health emergencies in Europe between 2008 and 2012. Gotz told a briefing arranged to present the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction’s report: “In Europe I do not know any government, or parliamentary majority backing a government, that is currently seriously discussing cannabis legalization or regulation in a different way. “I don’t see a discussion coming up of the level as it is in the Americas,” he said in Lisbon, the agency’s headquarters. Portugal pioneered the decriminalization of all drug use in 2001 and some countries have followed suit, making possession of small quantities of drugs, especially marijuana, a misdemeanor rather than criminal offence. Germany allows seriously ill patients to grow, buy and consume their own cannabis under a special license, and medical marijuana is legal in the Czech Republic, but otherwise cultivation and use remain illegal in the EU. In the United States, 23 states and the District of Columbia allow medical marijuana, and voters in four states have gone further by approving the drug for recreational use by adults. But the drug remains illegal under federal law, which classifies pot as a dangerous narcotic with no current medical use. The EU drug monitoring agency said technical innovation and market competition have led to an increase in the potency of cannabis, the purity of cocaine and the MDMA-content in ecstasy tablets. It also flagged market changes such as detection of heroin processing laboratories in Europe and a greater diversification of trafficking routes and opioid products, which, combined with a substantial increase in opium production in Afghanistan, could reverse declines in heroin supply and stagnation of demand.","Pandemic Fatigue: A Growing Concern for Public Health Experts

As the world enters its second year of grappling with the novel coronavirus, a new challenge is emerging on the horizon: pandemic fatigue. With restrictions and safety measures in place for an extended period, people are becoming weary and increasingly complacent, posing a significant threat to public health efforts.

Pandemic fatigue refers to the exhaustion and apathy individuals feel towards adhering to COVID-19 preventive measures such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and limiting gatherings. It has become a pressing concern, considering that these precautions are still necessary to curb the spread of the virus until widespread vaccination is achieved.

The prolonged nature of this global crisis has taken a toll on people's mental and emotional well-being. The initial waves of fear and uncertainty have transformed into frustration and low motivation to continue following guidelines. Experts warn that this fatigue could lead to a drastic decline in compliance, resulting in a surge of cases and subsequent strain on healthcare systems.

Public health officials across the globe have been sounding the alarm, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance. They urge individuals not to let their guard down and emphasize the importance of collective responsibility. Losing momentum now could undo months of progress made in controlling the virus's transmission.

One major factor contributing to pandemic fatigue is the disruption of daily routines. Remote work, online schooling, and limited social interaction have blurred the boundaries between personal and professional life. The lack of clear demarcation between work and leisure has amplified stress levels for many, leading to decreased motivation to follow COVID-19 protocols.

Additionally, the constant influx of disheartening news and growing frustrations surrounding vaccine distribution has further eroded public trust and contributed to the sense of fatigue. Despite promising developments with multiple vaccines being rolled out globally, logistical challenges and supply chain issues have hindered a smooth and rapid distribution process. This has left many feeling trapped in an ongoing cycle of restrictions with no clear end in sight.

Psychologists and public health experts stress the importance of addressing pandemic fatigue through empathetic communication, providing accurate information, and offering practical coping strategies. Messaging that acknowledges the challenges individuals are facing while highlighting the collective benefits of adherence to safety measures can help reinforce the need for continued vigilance.

Furthermore, communities must come together to support one another during these trying times. Local initiatives that provide resources, emotional support, and creative outlets for people to stay engaged have proven effective in combating pandemic fatigue. By fostering a sense of community resilience, individuals can be encouraged to persevere and continue their adherence to preventive measures.

It is also crucial for governments and organizations to prioritize mental health support for communities. Investing in accessible counseling services, promoting self-care practices, and offering outlets for stress reduction can help combat the negative impact of pandemic fatigue on individuals' overall well-being.

While the dawn of COVID-19 vaccines is undoubtedly cause for hope, it is imperative not to lose sight of the immediate challenges at hand. Pandemic fatigue represents a significant obstacle on the path to recovery. Each individual's commitment to following protocols and renewing efforts to protect themselves and others is vital for successfully overcoming this crisis.

As we navigate the weeks and months ahead, it is essential to remember that our choices and actions can shape the trajectory of the pandemic. By acknowledging and addressing pandemic fatigue head-on, we can ensure that progress towards containing the virus remains unhindered, taking us one step closer to a post-pandemic world.",true
8869,Novartis Sued in Calif. Over Kids' Cough Medicine.,"The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, said several studies have shown deaths and serious injuries linked to over-the-counter children’s cold remedies. As a result, Novartis “either knew ... or reasonably should have known that their cough and cold products were ineffective and dangerous when used by children under the age of six,” the lawsuit said. A Novartis spokeswoman said the company had not seen the lawsuit and had no comment on it. The company, which recalled Triaminic oral infant cough and cold medicines late last year, said it believed the lawsuit is the first to bring claims involving the drugs. The lawsuit was brought by Kelly Carter, who dosed her 4-year-old son with Triaminic Daytime Cough & Cold in 2007. It was not immediately clear from the lawsuit whether or how the drug harmed Carter’s son. Her attorney could not be reached for comment. Novartis sells a number of products under the Triaminic brand. The lawsuit alleges that Americans spend more than $2 billion annually on over-the counter cough and cold remedies for children. In October, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, a trade group representing makers of over-the-counter medicines, said overdoses of oral infant cough and cold medicines have led to death and serious injury in rare instances. The group stressed that the medications are safe when used as directed. U.S. Food and Drug Administration reviewers have recommended that over-the-counter cough and cold medicines that contain decongestants and antihistamines should come with new instructions saying they are not for very young children. According to a recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over-the-counter cough and cold drugs send an estimated 7,000 U.S. children under the age of 12 to emergency rooms every year, mostly for overdoses.","COVID-19 Variants Spark Concerns and Heightened Measures

As the world continues to battle the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, new variants of the virus are emerging, causing growing concerns among health officials and leading to the implementation of heightened measures to control their spread.

One of the most worrying variants is the Delta variant, originally identified in India. This highly transmissible strain has rapidly made its way across the globe and is now responsible for a significant portion of new infections in various countries. Experts fear that if left uncontained, the Delta variant could potentially lead to another surge in cases and pose challenges to healthcare systems.

Data from multiple studies suggest that the Delta variant is more contagious than previous strains such as Alpha (originating in the UK) and Beta (first detected in South Africa). It spreads easily through respiratory droplets and is believed to be more resistant to certain antibody treatments. Furthermore, evidence suggests that it may cause more severe illness and have an increased risk of hospitalization compared to other variants.

Due to the concerning nature of the Delta variant, governments worldwide are implementing proactive measures to slow its spread. Several countries have tightened border controls, imposing stricter quarantine requirements and travel restrictions for individuals coming from regions where the variant is prevalent. These measures aim to reduce the importation of the variant and prevent further community transmission.

Accelerated vaccination campaigns also play a crucial role in controlling the spread of COVID-19 variants. Health officials stress the importance of getting vaccinated and highlight that available vaccines offer excellent protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death, even when faced with the Delta variant. However, they acknowledge that achieving high vaccination rates is critical to ensure maximum effectiveness against existing and future variants.

In response to rising concerns about the Delta variant, some countries and regions have reintroduced mask mandates, particularly in indoor settings or crowded outdoor areas. Wearing masks not only provides added protection but also reduces the transmission of the virus through respiratory droplets.

Experts continue to monitor the situation closely, with ongoing genome sequencing of positive COVID-19 cases to detect and track the emergence of new variants. Early identification of these variants allows for rapid implementation of targeted measures to prevent further transmission. Additionally, research efforts are underway to determine the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the evolving strains and develop booster shots if necessary.

Despite the progress made in vaccination campaigns, health officials urge the public to remain cautious and follow recommended precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This includes practicing good hand hygiene, maintaining physical distance, avoiding crowded gatherings, and staying home when feeling unwell.

As virus variants continue to evolve, it is crucial for global collaboration and information sharing to tackle this ever-changing threat effectively. The scientific community and policymakers must work together to adapt strategies and implement necessary actions to stay ahead of the virus and protect public health.

In conclusion, the emergence of COVID-19 variants, particularly the highly transmissible Delta variant, has raised concerns among health officials worldwide. Stricter border controls, accelerated vaccination campaigns, and reintroduction of mask mandates are part of the increased measures taken to control their spread. Ongoing surveillance and research efforts are essential to monitor the situation and inform public health responses. However, individual responsibility also plays a vital role in mitigating the ongoing risk. By following recommended precautions and getting vaccinated, we can collectively combat the evolving threats posed by these variants and protect ourselves and our communities.",true
1822,"In Thailand, baby gender selection loophole draws China, HK women to IVF clinics.","“In Chinese tradition, a girl and a boy means good, perfect,” said the mother, who requested anonymity. “There’s nothing wrong with girls, but in Hong Kong and Chinese tradition all families like boys.”  The mother is one of hundreds of women from mainland China, Hong Kong and Australia who visit Bangkok each year for in vitro fertilization (IVF) with the option of choosing the child’s gender by discarding fertilized eggs, or embryos, of the unwanted sex. The only other countries where the technique is permitted and available are the United States and South Africa - in both cases at a higher financial cost. The dozen or so clinics that offer the service in Bangkok say it gives parents the chance to “balance” the genders in their growing families, but medical authorities want the practice banned. The Medical Council of Thailand, an independent agency that supervises the country’s medical system, says it could encourage embryo trafficking. Still, its efforts to stop IVF gender selection have been complicated by a number of factors. It has no powers to prevent clinics providing the service because there is no law governing its practice in Thailand. Despite years of lobbying, the issue has remained low on the list of political priorities for successive governments – a point underlined by Thailand’s latest political upheaval and military coup. In standard IVF practice, a woman’s eggs are removed and fertilized before being returned to the womb. In gender selection IVF, only embryos of the desired gender are implanted, a practice mostly shunned amid concerns about couples making a choice on the right to life based on gender. “Sex selection for non-medical reasons is not encouraged, but neither is it prohibited in the U.S., according to the latest guidelines,” the American Medical Association says on its Website. As in Thailand, South Africa currently has no legal provision governing the technique. The business is estimated to be worth about $150 million last year, according to one Hong Kong agent who organizes gender selection packages. Demand is growing about 20 percent a year, some Thai providers told Reuters, with the number of clinics rising to meet it. With parliament dissolved since last December and an army government now in power, calls for legislation remain in limbo. Thailand’s Health Ministry referred questions to the Royal Thai College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the only agency in the country which gathers specialized information about IVF treatment. Prof. Clin. Wiboolphan Thitadilok, president of the college, said the agency is working on a fresh set of recommendations on IVF treatment in general. “We have worked to put this issue into law for more than 10 years” she told Reuters. “It’s not an issue that politicians will pay much attention to.”  Thailand now has 44 IVF clinics in total, with seven new facilities opened last year and two or three applications for new clinics being submitted every month, according to the college. The Asian country has become the go-to destination for Chinese couples not willing to leave the gender of their baby to chance. They pay fees that can run close to $30,000 in some cases for packages including a cycle of treatment lasting two to three weeks. Alfred Siu Wing-fung, a Hong Kong agent selling Bangkok gender selection packages to about 200 Chinese couples a year, said as well as people from poorer rural areas his business, Eden Hospitality, had strong demand from wealthy professionals wanting certainty about their offspring. Siu estimates about 10,000 gender selection cycles were carried out in Bangkok last year, at an average cost of $15,000 per treatment. While medical equipment and drugs are imported, clinics are staffed mostly by Thai doctors and nurses trained overseas. He offers two packages: 280,000 Thai baht ($8,700) for a basic service including flights and accommodation, and 900,000 baht ($27,800) for VIP treatment, including nannies and catering. Interest is growing in Australia, where gender selection treatment is unavailable. Dr Robert Woolcott, director of Genea Ltd, the third-largest IVF company in Australia, said Genea routinely recommends that couples wishing to choose the gender of their baby visit Bangkok’s Superior A.R.T. (for Assisted Reproductive Technology), a clinic it partly owns. Overall, Australians numbering “in the hundreds per year” travel to Thailand for gender selection, Woolcott told Reuters. Back in Hong Kong, the mother, now 28 with a healthy 18-month-old son, is planning for her third child. She probably won’t go back to Bangkok. “I think the third one should be natural,” she said.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt lives across the globe, an increasing number of people are receiving vaccinations, which is proving to have a significant positive impact on curbing the spread of the virus. The vaccination efforts have resulted in a decline in new cases and hospitalizations, providing hope for a gradual return to normalcy.

The initial rollout of COVID-19 vaccines faced numerous challenges, from vaccine distribution logistics to vaccine hesitancy among some individuals. However, with time, these obstacles have been overcome, leading to a steady increase in the number of vaccinated individuals. According to recent data from health authorities, over 30% of the population has now received at least one dose of the vaccine in many countries.

One of the most notable effects of the vaccination campaign is the decline in new COVID-19 cases. In regions where a large portion of the population has been vaccinated, there has been a remarkable drop in the number of infections reported. This decline is particularly evident among vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. The effectiveness of vaccines in preventing severe illness and reducing hospitalizations has been a game-changer in improving overall public health and reducing strain on healthcare systems.

Additionally, studies have shown that the vaccines currently authorized for emergency use offer protection against new variants of the coronavirus. With the emergence of new strains that are more transmissible, having an effective defense against these variants becomes crucial. Recent research conducted by leading scientific institutions demonstrates that the available vaccines maintain a high level of efficacy against these variants. This finding provides reassurance that the ongoing vaccination efforts will continue to mitigate the threat posed by evolving forms of the virus.

In addition to the decline in cases, the vaccination campaign has had a profound impact on reducing hospitalizations related to COVID-19. Hospitals that were once overwhelmed with patients are beginning to see relief as fewer individuals require intensive care due to the disease. The data indicates that vaccinated individuals are significantly less likely to experience severe symptoms or require hospitalization upon contracting the virus. This not only preserves healthcare resources but also allows medical professionals to attend to other critical medical needs, improving overall quality of care.

Furthermore, as vaccination rates increase, countries are starting to relax certain restrictions that have been in place for months. With a significant portion of the population now protected against severe illness, governments feel more confident in gradually reopening businesses, educational institutions, and other public spaces. This step toward normalcy is a welcome change after months of lockdowns and physical distancing measures.

While the progress made through vaccination efforts is promising, it is crucial to note that the fight against COVID-19 is far from over. Vaccine distribution must continue to reach all corners of the globe and address inequities in access. Efforts to educate the public about vaccine safety, efficacy, and the importance of getting vaccinated must also be intensified, especially in communities with low vaccination rates.

In conclusion, the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations is undeniable. As more people receive their doses, there has been a significant decline in new cases and hospitalizations. The vaccines have proven effective against new variants and have provided hope for a return to normalcy. However, continued vigilance and efforts to ensure global vaccine equity remain important factors in defeating the devastating effects of the pandemic.",true
6716,Predators’ Watson: Alcohol issues led to his arrest.,"Watson, who turns 27 on Sunday, said Friday in an Instagram post that he’s been dealing with anxiety, depression and alcoholism since the age of 18. Watson said he voluntarily entered the NHL’s substance abuse program after his June 16 arrest. “I am currently sober and committed to living a healthy lifestyle so that I can be the father, partner, teammate and person I want to be,” Watson said. Watson pleaded no contest July 24 to domestic assault and agreed to a judicial diversion program that enabled the misdemeanor charge to be dismissed if he served three months of probation and completed an in-patient treatment program and a batterer’s intervention program. He initially received a 27-game suspension from the NHL, but an arbitrator reduced it to 18 games. He was reinstated in mid-November and has six goals and two assists in 28 games this season. Watson was arrested in connection with a June 16 incident after a witness flagged down a police officer to a gas station in Franklin Tennessee. According to the incident report, Watson told police he and his girlfriend were arguing and that he pushed her. Officers said they found red marks on her chest, and she said Watson caused them. Watson’s girlfriend, Jenn Guardino, issued a statement in October taking blame for the incident and saying Watson would never hit or abuse her. In her statement, Guardino said she had “struggled with alcoholism for many years.” In his Instagram post, Watson said that he and his girlfriend were “engaged in a heated, nonphysical argument” that day. Watson said that both he and his girlfriend had relapsed in their battles with alcoholism during the month leading up to the incident. “I did not cause marks on her chest or blood on her leg,” Watson said. “I did handle matters that day poorly and did not uphold the standards of an employee of the Nashville Predators or National Hockey League. “I take full responsibility for my involvement in the argument and have learned from the situation and taken the necessary steps to ensure that nothing of this nature happens again.” Watson added that he and his girlfriend are “healthy, happy and committed to our own individual sobriety as well as continuing to strengthen our relationship.” “We have learned from our mistakes and are excited to move forward in our relationship,” Watson said. “We wish only to raise our daughter Olivia in the most healthy and loving atmosphere we can provide.” ___ More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports","Pandemic Fatigue: A Growing Concern Amidst Rising COVID-19 Cases

As the world grapples with an ongoing battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, a new adversary has emerged: pandemic fatigue. With each passing day, individuals and communities are becoming increasingly weary of the long-lasting restrictions, resulting in a concerning disregard for safety measures. This alarming development poses significant risks as global COVID-19 cases continue to rise.

Pandemic fatigue is characterized by a collective exhaustion stemming from the prolonged uncertainty, fear, and isolation experienced during the pandemic. People are tired of adhering to social distancing guidelines, wearing masks, and limiting social interactions. They yearn for a return to normalcy, unable to sustain their vigilance in the face of mounting challenges.

This onset of fatigue can be attributed to several factors. First and foremost, the protracted timeline of the pandemic has tested the patience and resilience of individuals worldwide. What was initially anticipated to be a short-term disruption has now raged on for months, leading to frustration and disillusionment. With no immediate end in sight, people find it increasingly difficult to maintain the same level of compliance as in the early stages of the crisis.

Furthermore, the economic fallout resulting from lockdowns and business closures has caused extreme financial strain. Unemployment rates have soared, businesses have shuttered, and livelihoods have been shattered. As individuals struggle to make ends meet, the significance of earning a living begins to overshadow concerns about contracting the virus. Desperation for economic stability may drive some to ignore safety precautions altogether.

The contradictory messages emanating from authorities have also contributed to pandemic fatigue. The confusion and inconsistency surrounding guidelines, policies, and recommendations have left individuals unsure of how best to protect themselves and their loved ones. Mixed messaging has eroded trust in public health authorities, leaving many questioning the validity and necessity of safety measures.

Another key driver of pandemic fatigue is the psychological toll inflicted by social isolation. Humans are inherently social creatures, and the forced separation from loved ones takes a heavy toll on mental well-being. As months turn into a year, the longing for human connection grows stronger, prompting individuals to take risks and prioritize their emotional needs over physical health.

The consequences of pandemic fatigue are dire. In countries where compliance with safety measures has waned, we have witnessed a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. The hard-won gains made during earlier lockdowns and sacrifices risk being reversed as people let down their guard. The potential strain on healthcare systems is alarming, as hospitals become overwhelmed with a surge in patients.

However, there is still hope. Addressing pandemic fatigue requires a multifaceted approach. Clear and consistent messaging from trusted authorities is crucial to restoring public confidence and renewing commitment to safety measures. Implementing targeted interventions to alleviate the economic burden on individuals and communities can also help reduce desperation and the subsequent disregard for precautions.

Moreover, fostering empathy and compassion within society can go a long way in supporting one another through these challenging times. By acknowledging the shared struggles and finding ways to connect and support each other safely, we can mitigate the effects of pandemic fatigue on mental health.

Pandemic fatigue is a significant concern that cannot be overlooked. It threatens to undermine the progress made thus far in combating the global health crisis. Combating this fatigue will require a collective effort from governments, communities, and individuals alike. Only by recognizing the exhaustion and taking proactive steps to address it can we ensure the continued safety and well-being of our society.",true
8781,"Study finds 140,000 bad reactions to antibiotics.","The findings offer another reason for doctors to limit  their use of the drugs, which are overused in the United  States, the team at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention said. “This number is an important reminder for physicians and  patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and  should only be taken when necessary,” said the CDC’s Dr. Daniel  Budnitz, who led the study. For the first report ever done on adverse reactions to  antibiotics in the United States, the researchers used the  National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative  Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project, a sample of 63 U.S.  hospitals, between 2004 and 2006. They found more than 6,600 emergency visits were due to an  adverse reaction to an antibiotic. They used formulas to  extrapolate this to the whole country and estimated that  142,000 such emergency visits are made every year. “Systemic antibiotics (pills or injections as opposed to  creams) were implicated in 19.3 percent of all emergency  department visits for drug-related adverse events,” they wrote  in the September 15 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases. Penicillin and related antibiotics such as amoxicillin,  widely prescribed and widely seen as safe, accounted for half  the emergency visits. Other classes of antibiotics such as  cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and newer antibiotics  accounted for the rest. “Persons aged 15-44 years accounted for an estimated 41.2  percent of ED visits. Infants accounted for only an estimated  6.3 percent of ED visits,” they wrote. Budnitz and colleagues said 78 percent of the adverse  events in the study were allergic reactions, ranging from rash  to a serious reaction known as anaphylaxis, and the remaining  22 percent were caused by errors and overdoses. Many studies have suggested that half of the estimated 100  million antibiotic prescriptions written for respiratory tract  infections in the United States are unnecessary. Most such  infections are caused by viruses, and antibiotics are useless  against them. But, Budnitz and colleagues said, doctors still often  believe their patients are exceptions to the rule and continue  to write the prescriptions. “Because antibiotics are frequently used, both  appropriately and inappropriately, if doctors would reduce the  number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even  a small percentage, we could significantly reduce the number of  emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events,” Budnitz said  in a statement. “Antibiotics are among the most frequently used medications  in the United States. Annually, antibiotics are prescribed to  an estimated 16 percent of patients during ambulatory care  visits, and pharmaceutical manufacturers spend $1 billion  promoting antibiotics,” Budnitz wrote.","COVID-19 Vaccines: Critical Tools in Combating the Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc worldwide, claiming millions of lives and disrupting livelihoods. As the world races against time to bring an end to this crisis, vaccines have emerged as critical tools in the fight against the virus. With their unprecedented development and remarkable efficacy, COVID-19 vaccines have offered hope for a brighter future.

Since the onset of the pandemic, researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and governments have collaborated tirelessly to develop safe and effective vaccines. The rapid pace at which these vaccines were developed is nothing short of extraordinary. What would typically take years or even decades was achieved in less than a year, thanks to advancements in technology and international cooperation.

The arrival of vaccines brought renewed optimism, but it also raised questions among the public. Are they safe? Can they be trusted? These concerns are natural, given the expedited development process. However, rigorous testing and adherence to regulatory standards ensured that no corners were cut in guaranteeing their safety and efficacy.

Multiple vaccines have gained emergency use authorization from regulatory bodies around the globe. Clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants have found them to be highly effective in preventing COVID-19 infections. For instance, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, based on mRNA technology, have reported efficacy rates above 90%. Other vaccines, such as AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, have also shown strong efficacy in preventing severe illness and hospitalizations.

Vaccination campaigns have since kicked off in numerous countries, prioritizing high-risk populations such as healthcare workers, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions. These campaigns have successfully administered millions of doses, providing a glimmer of hope amid the pandemic's bleakness.

Apart from protecting individuals from severe illness and hospitalization, vaccination programs aim to achieve herd immunity, a key milestone in controlling the spread of the virus. Herd immunity occurs when a significant portion of the population is immune, either through vaccination or previous infection. This effectively limits the virus's ability to find new hosts, eventually leading to its eradication.

However, challenges persist in global vaccine distribution and access. Disparities between countries and socioeconomic groups have raised concerns about equitable distribution. Wealthier nations have secured substantial vaccine supplies, while poorer countries struggle to vaccinate even a fraction of their populations. Bridging this gap requires international collaboration, sharing of resources, and collective efforts to ensure vaccines reach those in need worldwide.

Another concern that has emerged is the increasing prevalence of COVID-19 variants. The virus constantly mutates, giving rise to different strains with potentially altered characteristics. Vaccines currently in use have shown varying degrees of effectiveness against these variants. Researchers and pharmaceutical companies are closely monitoring these developments and working to adapt the vaccines accordingly to maintain their effectiveness.

To address public skepticism, authorities play a crucial role in disseminating accurate information and communicating the benefits and safety of COVID-19 vaccines. By debunking misinformation and addressing concerns transparently, governments can build trust and encourage vaccination acceptance, facilitating a smoother path toward recovery.

COVID-19 vaccines represent a milestone achievement in mankind's battle against the pandemic. While challenges lie ahead, they offer a beacon of hope and the potential to turn the tide against this devastating virus. In the coming months, as vaccination efforts ramp up globally, it is essential for individuals to embrace the opportunity to protect themselves, their communities, and contribute to the collective goal of defeating COVID-19 once and for all.",true

Proponents say the merger would benefit patients, but opponents worry it would increase costs and reduce access to health care.","Faster COVID-19 Variant Spreads Concern Among Experts

As the world grapples with the ongoing battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, a new cause for concern has emerged: a faster-spreading variant of the virus. This mutation, known as B.1.1.7, has grabbed the attention of public health experts worldwide due to its potential to increase transmission rates and further strain healthcare systems.

Originally detected in the United Kingdom, this variant quickly made its way across borders, leading to widespread travel restrictions and heightened monitoring efforts. As scientists work diligently to understand its impact, several critical aspects of the B.1.1.7 variant have come to light.

First and foremost, research shows that the new strain is up to 70% more transmissible than its predecessors. This means that infected individuals are now more likely to spread the virus to others, potentially leading to exponential growth in cases. Health authorities are worried that a surge in infections could overwhelm hospitals already stretched thin by the relentless demands of the pandemic.

Alarmingly, preliminary findings also suggest that the B.1.1.7 variant may be linked to an increased risk of severe illness and mortality. While further studies are still underway to confirm these associations, the notion of a potentially deadlier strain adds urgency to the need for preventative measures.

The existing COVID-19 vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies have shown promise in combating the new variant. Early data suggests that the current vaccines remain effective against the B.1.1.7 strain, providing some reassurance amid growing concerns. However, experts caution that continued monitoring and surveillance are crucial to understanding any future alterations in the virus and ensuring vaccine efficacy.

Public health authorities have reiterated the importance of adhering to recommended preventive measures, emphasizing their effectiveness in preventing the spread of both the original virus and its variants. Measures such as mask-wearing, maintaining physical distance, frequent handwashing, and avoiding crowded spaces remain essential to curbing transmission.

In response to the evolving situation, some countries have opted for stricter measures. Lockdowns and travel restrictions have been reinstated in parts of Europe and other regions with confirmed cases of the B.1.1.7 variant. Authorities believe that stringent actions are necessary to slow down the virus's spread and gain better control over the situation.

With concerns about the new variant on the rise, experts are emphasizing the need for improved genomic surveillance and testing capacity. Identifying and tracking different strains is vital not only for the development of effective vaccines but also for informed public health decision-making.

As scientists globally work tirelessly to understand and respond to this new challenge posed by the B.1.1.7 variant, it is crucial for individuals to stay informed and follow guidelines provided by health authorities. Although the road ahead may still be uncertain, collective efforts to curb transmission and protect vulnerable populations can help mitigate the risks associated with these emerging variants.

Ultimately, this ongoing battle against COVID-19 demands constant vigilance, adaptability, and a united global approach to safeguard public health. As more is learned about the B.1.1.7 strain and its implications, scientists and policymakers must adjust strategies accordingly to overcome this latest hurdle in our fight against the pandemic.",true
2078,Surgery prevents breast cancers in high-risk women.,"Vasiliki Kostoula, a Greek breast cancer patient, is framed through a breast x-ray after a radiological medical examination in an Athens hospital October 29, 2008. REUTERS/Yannis Behrakis The study shows the benefits of genetic tests that give women with a family history of cancer the chance to take steps to increase their chances of survival, they said. “This is the first study to prove women survive longer with these preventive surgeries and shows the importance of genetic testing when there is a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer,” Dr. Virginia Kaklamani of Northwestern University in Chicago wrote in a commentary about the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Women with mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes have a 56 to 84 percent higher risk of developing breast cancer during their lifetimes. Those with the BRCA1 mutation also have a 36 to 63 percent higher risk of ovarian cancer and those with the BRCA2 mutation have a 10 to 27 percent higher risk of ovarian cancer. Because of this, many women make the difficult choice to have their breasts or ovaries and fallopian tubes surgically removed to reduce their risk. Dr. Susan M. Domchek of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia and colleagues studied the effectiveness of these procedures in 2,482 women with BRCA mutations, including 247 women who had risk-reducing surgery to remove their breasts and 993 who had risk-reducing surgery to remove their ovaries. No woman who had a mastectomy developed breast cancer during the three years of follow-up testing. Seven percent of women who decided against a mastectomy were diagnosed with breast cancer in the same period. “Our results confirm that risk-reducing mastectomy is associated with a significant reduction in breast cancer risk,” Domchek and colleagues wrote. Women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations who had their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed had similar results. About 10 to 20 percent of breast and ovarian cancers are due to BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. “Most of these women will die of ovarian cancer, so you can save 20 percent of them with the prophylactic surgery,” Kaklamani said. “And you can save the majority of women who would have died of their breast cancer,” she added. She said primary care physicians, gynecologists and women “need to be more aware that these tests exist.”   Dr. Sandhya Pruthi, a breast cancer expert at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who counsels women with BRCA mutations, said the study adds more evidence that the surgery can help save lives, but the choice is never easy. “It’s not cookie-cutter medicine,” Pruthi, who was not involved in the study, said in a telephone interview. She said women need to come to terms with the psychological issues involved in having their breasts removed, and younger women who have their ovaries removed must contend with early menopause symptoms. “It’s not a decision made on a single visit,” she said. According to the American Cancer Society and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, 1.3 million new breast cancer cases are diagnosed around the world every year and it kills 465,000 women annually, making it the leading global cancer killer of women.","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the significance of accurate and timely information. As a news reporter specializing in public health and COVID-19 news, my role is to deliver crucial updates to keep the population well-informed. With the constant influx of new research and developments, it is essential to navigate through the noise and convey accurate information to the public.

One primary focus during this ongoing pandemic should center around vaccine efficacy and safety. Recent studies have provided encouraging data, demonstrating that approved vaccines are highly effective in reducing severe illness, hospitalizations, and fatalities among those who have received their shots. For instance, recent research published in reputable medical journals has shown that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have proven more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 infections, even with the emergence of new variants.

Additionally, the rapid development of vaccines such as Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine has expanded accessibility to immunization efforts. This vaccine has proven highly effective in combating severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths related to COVID-19. Reports indicate that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been found to be 66.3% effective overall against moderate to severe cases of COVID-19, including protection against variants like the Delta variant.

However, concerns related to breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals have surfaced as well. These instances occur when fully vaccinated individuals contract the virus despite receiving their recommended doses. It is important to provide accurate information to counteract any misconceptions surrounding these cases. Breakthrough infections may still occur due to various factors, including waning immunity over time and the presence of new variants that may partially evade the immune response. While these infections can happen, the vast majority result in mild or no symptoms, significantly reducing the risk of hospitalization or death.

Moreover, it is crucial to address vaccine hesitancy, which continues to pose a challenge in achieving herd immunity. Educating the public about the safety and efficacy of currently approved vaccines is essential to overcome this hurdle. Scientific evidence shows that the approved COVID-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and rigorous approval processes, ensuring their safety and effectiveness. Communicating these facts transparently is vital in building trust with those who remain skeptical or hesitant.

Variants of concern, such as the Delta variant, have also contributed to the urgency of vaccination efforts. Recent studies show that fully vaccinated individuals are significantly protected against severe illness and hospitalizations even when facing these more transmissible variants. However, it is important to emphasize the importance of continued adherence to preventive measures, such as mask-wearing and social distancing, particularly in areas experiencing surges or low vaccination rates.

In conclusion, accurate and timely information dissemination plays a critical role in public health, especially during a pandemic. It is imperative for news reporters specializing in COVID-19 to provide fact-based reporting on vaccine efficacy, breakthrough infections, and the significance of preventive measures. By doing so, we can facilitate informed decision-making and help combat vaccine hesitancy while fostering a safer environment for all.",true

District Health Department No. 4 said flu has been widespread for five to six weeks in the northeastern Lower Peninsula.","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact communities around the world, it has become increasingly important for individuals to prioritize their mental health. With the ongoing stress and uncertainty that accompanies the current public health crisis, experts are stressing the need for people to take proactive measures to safeguard their emotional well-being.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has called attention to the psychological toll of the pandemic, pointing out that fear, anxiety, and loneliness are prevalent among many individuals. The sense of isolation caused by lockdowns and social distancing measures has served as a breeding ground for negative emotions and mental health challenges.

In response to these concerns, mental health professionals have emphasized the significance of self-care during this difficult time. Simple activities such as maintaining a routine, incorporating exercise into daily life, and engaging in hobbies can help individuals cope with increased stress levels. Psychiatrists have also recommended setting boundaries in terms of media consumption, as excessive exposure to pandemic-related news can be overwhelming and contribute to feelings of anxiety.

Additionally, mental health experts have highlighted the importance of fostering a support network. Virtual platforms have proven instrumental in maintaining social connections while adhering to physical distancing guidelines. Regular video calls or messaging with loved ones provides a means of staying connected despite physical limitations. Online therapy sessions have also emerged as a valuable resource, offering professional guidance and support to those struggling with their mental well-being.

Furthermore, organizations dedicated to mental health advocacy have ramped up efforts to provide crucial resources to those in need. Hotlines staffed by volunteers who lend an empathetic ear and offer guidance have seen a surge in demand. Crisis text lines, online forums, and mental health apps have also experienced increased usage, serving as convenient outlets for individuals seeking support from the comfort of their own homes.

Recognizing the long-term impact of the pandemic on mental health, some governments have taken steps to address the issue. Mental health initiatives, virtual counseling services, and outreach programs have been launched to ensure that individuals have access to the support they require.

However, while progress has been made in raising awareness about mental health during the pandemic, disparities still exist. Vulnerable populations such as frontline healthcare workers, COVID-19 survivors, and those who have lost loved ones to the virus may require specialized care and attention.

In conclusion, the pandemic has unquestionably affected people's mental health. It is crucial for individuals to recognize the impact of the crisis on their emotional well-being and actively prioritize self-care. Seeking support from friends, families, and professionals, whether through virtual means or other resources, can prove invaluable in navigating the challenges posed by this ongoing public health emergency. By acknowledging the importance of mental health and taking appropriate steps to address it, individuals can work towards maintaining a sense of balance and resilience during these uncertain times.",true
8885,FDA says Germany recalls blood-thinner heparin.,"The recall brings into question the safety of European supplies of the drug, which become the target of a U.S. investigation after a spike in fatalities and severe reactions in some patients taking heparin sold by Baxter International Inc.   “What is significant about the German recall is that the heparin active ingredient in their product was not obtained from SPL,” or Scientific Protein Labs, Baxter’s supplier, FDA Deputy Commissioner Janet Woodcock said. “We’re concerned about worldwide, this contaminant, in heparin and making sure it is safe, (and) out of the heparin supply,” Woodcock said. German authorities do not expect a shortage of the drug, FDA said. The FDA began probing Baxter’s heparin several weeks ago after it was linked with to four deaths and hundreds of severe reactions, such as breathing problems and rapid drops in blood pressure. On Wednesday it said it identified a contaminant that may be linked with the drug’s problems. Some 19 fatalities have now been associated with use of the drug in the United States, the FDA said on Wednesday. However, all the deaths have not been linked to a specific drug maker. The other major U.S. heparin supplier, APP Pharmaceuticals Inc, has ramped up production to avoid a drug shortage. Tests on APP’s heparin have not found any contamination, Woodcock said on Wednesday. No fatalities were seen in Germany, and “less than 100” severe reactions led to the recall, the FDA said. The German product manufacturer, Rotexmedica GmbH, could not be immediately reached for comment. Heparin is derived from pig intestines. It is used in dialysis and heart procedures, among other surgeries, to avoid blood clots. FDA officials also advised companies and countries to begin using a sophisticated testing technique the agency used to find the potential contaminant, to test all heparin on the market. “With this testing method, there will be a way to protect the heparin supply,” Woodcock said. Baxter’s main supplier is Wisconsin-based Scientific Protein Laboratories LLC (SPL), which has a major facility in China, a main subject of FDA’s investigation. About 80 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients come from foreign sources, according to U.S. government investigators. Most of the world’s heparin supply is from China, according to Baxter. The FDA inspects only about 7 percent of foreign manufacturing facilities annually, according to the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog agency. China’s reputation has been tainted after health scares with pigs and massive recalls of pet food and children’s toys containing lead paint. Sidney Wolfe, head of health research at the consumer group Public Citizen, said the FDA has poorly allocated its resources for inspections. “China has a tiny fraction of plants being inspected as opposed to India, which is dangerous considering that China is a country far less advanced,” Wolfe said. The FDA conducted about 13 inspections at Chinese plants in 2007, versus 65 at plants in India. China has 714 facilities against India’s 410, according to the GAO report. Baxter has recalled most of its U.S. supplies of the drug. It sells the product in other European countries but not in Germany. But Baxter does not sell the specific vial-based product linked to the four U.S. deaths in European markets, company spokeswoman Erin Gardiner said.","New CDC Guidelines Recommend Wearing Masks Indoors, Regardless of Vaccination Status 

As the Delta variant continues to drive a surge in COVID-19 cases across the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its guidelines, urging individuals to wear masks indoors in areas with substantial or high transmission rates.

The new recommendations mark a significant shift in the CDC's stance on mask-wearing. Previously, the agency had stated that fully vaccinated individuals could safely forego masks both outdoors and indoors. However, with emerging evidence suggesting that fully vaccinated people can still transmit the Delta variant, health officials are taking precautionary measures to curb the virus's spread.

Many regions in the U.S. are witnessing an alarming rise in COVID-19 cases fueled by this highly transmissible variant. Consequently, the CDC advises people residing in these areas, regardless of their vaccination status, to resume wearing masks indoors to protect themselves and others from potential infection.

Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the CDC, explained the rationale behind the updated recommendation during a recent press briefing. ""This moment, and most importantly, the associated illness, suffering, and death could have been avoided with higher vaccination coverage in this country,"" she emphasized. Dr. Walensky further reiterated the importance of vaccines, highlighting that they remain the most effective tool in combating the virus and preventing severe disease.

The revised guidance is not limited solely to areas experiencing substantial or high transmission rates but extends to K-12 schools nationwide. With millions of children preparing to return to in-person learning this fall, the CDC strongly advises that all students, teachers, staff, and visitors wear masks inside educational institutions, regardless of vaccination status. The agency emphasized the role of layered prevention strategies, including universal masking, in keeping schools safer and facilitating uninterrupted learning.

Mask mandates have already started to resurface across several cities and states in response to rising case numbers. Los Angeles County, for instance, has reinstated its indoor mask requirement for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Similarly, health officials in Chicago are advising residents to wear masks indoors as a precautionary measure.

However, the CDC's updated guidelines do not call for a return of widespread lockdowns or business closures at this time. Instead, they underscore the need for local public health authorities to carefully consider implementing measures that align with the current transmission rates and vaccination coverage in their respective communities.

Public health experts hope that the revised recommendations will help reinvigorate the nation's efforts to combat COVID-19. As vaccination rates stagnate, the Delta variant continues to pose significant risks to unvaccinated individuals, who account for the majority of hospitalizations and deaths. Wearing masks indoors and following other preventative measures may play a crucial role in curbing the spread of the virus, safeguarding vulnerable populations, and avoiding overwhelming strain on healthcare systems.

It is worth noting that the reality of our fight against COVID-19 remains dynamic, influenced by emerging scientific evidence, real-time data, and evolving circumstances. As such, public health guidance will continue to adapt to best protect the population.

1683,Medical marijuana farm blooms in conservative Chile.,"A debut crop of around 100 kilos (221 lbs) of prime cannabis bud - with a value of $2 million on the street - was harvested this month from the farm in La Florida, a middle-class Santiago neighborhood, and sent to a laboratory for processing. The project is the brainchild of a curious alliance between Rodolfo Carter, a right-wing municipal mayor with progressive tendencies, and a privately-funded foundation ran by Ana Maria Gazmuri, a 1980s TV soap star who is now an advocate for alternative “holistic” medicine. Scientists plan to extract the active ingredients from the cannabis for use in the treatment of 200 cancer patients who signed up via the local healthcare system or through the foundation. “If there is a therapeutic property to cannabis that relieves pain it would be a criminal irresponsibility as a leader not to give it to citizens who need it,” Carter said at the farm, where the strong smell of marijuana lingers and security staff keep a watchful eye. Although Chile has not followed Uruguay’s lead in legalizing marijuana, it allows the cultivation and use of the plant for medicinal purposes. Cannabis-derived treatments have been found to relieve pain and stimulate hunger in cancer patients, as well as help children with epilepsy. Demand in Chile for medicinal marijuana has far outstripped supply, Gazmuri said. Municipalities from Arica in the country’s far north to Punta Arenas in Patagonia have show interest in setting up a larger farm, she said. “We are working with around 20 local governments, looking at a large plantation to optimize resources,” she said. Besides dealing with the logistical issues of growing a crop attractive to drug traffickers and only legal under certain conditions, the project had to overcome a social stigma attached to marijuana. For some years following the 1974-1990 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, Chile remained an extremely conservative country, where abortion and divorce were outlawed and illicit drug use heavily punished. But left-wing governments have taken baby steps in recent years towards a more liberal path, legalizing gay and lesbian civil partnerships and proposing a loosening of abortion rules, as well as giving the nod to start up the La Florida project. “I belong to a generation that considered marijuana was linked to people who lived on the margins of the law, but it’s not like that,” said Carter, 43. “It’s a change of mentality that began with me.”","COVID-19 Has Lasting Impact on Mental Health: A Pandemic Within a Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has not only brought about a global health crisis but has also had a profound impact on people's mental well-being. As countries implemented strict lockdown measures and individuals grappled with fear, uncertainty, and social isolation, mental health concerns skyrocketed. Experts are now warning that the effects of this ""pandemic within a pandemic"" will be long-lasting and require special attention.

The onset of the pandemic saw a surge in anxiety and depression cases worldwide. The fear of contracting the virus, witnessing loved ones fall ill or succumb to the disease, and experiencing economic hardships created a perfect storm for mental health struggles. Isolation from friends and family due to social distancing measures further exacerbated these problems.

According to a survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder increased considerably compared to pre-pandemic levels. The survey revealed that 41% of respondents experienced at least one adverse mental or behavioral health condition, such as anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, trauma-related symptoms, or substance abuse related to the pandemic.

The impact of COVID-19 on mental health is not limited to adults; children and adolescents are also significantly affected. School closures, disrupted routines, and decreased social interaction have led to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression among young people. The American Academy of Pediatrics reported an alarming rise in pediatric mental health emergencies during the pandemic, emphasizing the urgent need for support and intervention.

In addition to the direct psychological consequences of the pandemic, the secondary effects are also taking a toll on mental health. Economic strain, job loss, and financial insecurity have contributed to heightened stress levels and anxiety. These factors, coupled with limited access to healthcare services and treatment, have created a challenging situation for many individuals seeking mental health support.

Experts are now reminding society that we need to acknowledge the significance of mental health as an essential component of overall well-being. Governments and healthcare systems must invest in accessible and affordable mental health services, ensuring that individuals have the support they need.

Efforts are underway to address the mental health crisis associated with the pandemic. Mental health hotlines and helplines have been established in various countries to provide support to those in distress. Telemedicine has also played a crucial role in bridging the gap between patients and mental healthcare providers, enabling virtual consultations and therapy sessions.

Furthermore, destigmatizing mental health is paramount during these times. Adequate education and awareness campaigns can help reduce the social barriers surrounding seeking help for mental health conditions. It is vital that people understand that seeking professional assistance is not a sign of weakness but instead a courageous step towards recovery.

As the world strives to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of COVID-19, attention must be given to healing the invisible wounds inflicted on mental health. The lasting effects of this pandemic within a pandemic will continue to impact individuals, families, and communities for years to come. The battle to prioritize mental health is ongoing, but with collective efforts and a unified commitment, we can provide the necessary support and care to all those affected. Only then can we truly overcome this dual crisis and restore a sense of well-being to our societies.",true
201,U.S. judge orders big drug companies to face opioid trial.,"U.S. District Judge Dan Polster, who oversees roughly 2,000 opioid lawsuits by states, counties and cities, said the plaintiffs can try to prove that drugmakers’ deceptive marketing of the painkillers caused a harmful, massive increase in supply that pharmacies and distributors did not do enough to stop. “A factfinder could reasonably infer that these failures were a substantial factor in producing the alleged harm suffered by plaintiffs,” the Cleveland-based judge wrote. The ruling was among seven decisions and orders totaling 80 pages from Polster ahead of a scheduled Oct. 21 trial by two Ohio counties against Purdue Pharma, the OxyContin maker accused of fueling the epidemic, and several other defendants. Polster also refused to dismiss civil conspiracy claims against drugmakers, pharmacies and distributors, and said federal law did not preempt much of the plaintiffs’ case. Other defendants included the drugmakers Endo International Plc and Johnson & Johnson; pharmacy operators CVS Health Corp, Rite Aid Corp, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Walmart Inc; and distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and McKesson Corp.  Polster also refused to dismiss a variety of claims against generic drugmakers Allergan Plc, Mallinckrodt Plc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.  Opioid addiction claimed roughly 400,000 lives in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Critics of the industry said opioid makers hid the addiction and abuse risks of prolonged use from consumers. Rite Aid’s lawyers declined to comment. Lawyers for other major defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Paul Hanly, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his clients were pleased that Polster “almost uniformly” agreed with their positions on the dismissal requests and whether to admit various testimony. J&J has said it will appeal an Oklahoma judge’s Aug. 26 order that it pay $572.1 million to that state for the company’s role in the opioid epidemic. Purdue and its owners, the Sackler family, have been in talks on a possible $10 billion to $12 billion nationwide settlement of opioid claims, two people familiar with the matter said last week. That accord could include a bankruptcy filing for the Stamford, Connecticut-based company. Purdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations. The case is In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Ohio, No. 17-md-02804.","Pregnant Women and COVID-19: Understanding the Risks and Precautions

COVID-19 has left no stone unturned in its impact on our lives. As researchers continue to study the virus, we are learning more about how it affects different groups, including pregnant women. New studies shed light on the risks associated with COVID-19 during pregnancy and underline the importance of taking necessary precautions.

Recent research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that pregnant women might be at an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 when compared to non-pregnant women of the same age group. Furthermore, pregnant individuals with COVID-19 may also face an elevated risk of preterm birth, as well as other adverse pregnancy outcomes.

One study conducted at the University of California, San Francisco analyzed data from 240,000 pregnant patients who had tested positive for COVID-19. The results were concerning, as they found that pregnant women infected with the virus were more likely to require intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and experience complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes.

However, it is important to note that these risks may vary depending on individual factors such as maternal age, pre-existing health conditions, and access to prenatal care. It is crucial for pregnant women to consult their healthcare providers to assess their specific risks and develop a tailored approach to protect both the mother and the unborn child.

To minimize the risk of contracting COVID-19, pregnant individuals should adhere to the same preventive measures recommended for the general population. These include wearing masks in public settings, practicing good hand hygiene by frequently washing hands or using hand sanitizers, maintaining physical distance from others, and avoiding large gatherings.

In addition to these general precautions, pregnant women should also prioritize prenatal care and attend all scheduled appointments. Regular visits to healthcare providers allow them to closely monitor the pregnancy and address any concerns or complications promptly. Telehealth appointments may be an alternative option for low-risk pregnancies to minimize exposure to crowded healthcare facilities.

Vaccination against COVID-19 has been a topic of discussion among pregnant individuals and their healthcare providers. The CDC, along with several professional organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), recommend that pregnant women should have access to COVID-19 vaccines and discuss the potential risks and benefits with their healthcare provider. While studies on vaccine safety during pregnancy are limited, initial data suggests that the available vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to pregnant women or their babies.

Moreover, vaccinations can offer protection to both the mother and the newborn through the transfer of antibodies. This is particularly important considering infants are not eligible for vaccination until they reach a certain age.

In summary, while pregnant individuals may face an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, taking appropriate precautions can help mitigate these risks. Adhering to preventive measures, attending prenatal care appointments, and discussing vaccination options with healthcare providers can provide valuable guidance in protecting the health of both the mother and the baby. As we continue to navigate the pandemic, staying informed and taking necessary steps is crucial in ensuring the well-being of pregnant individuals and their families.",true
6669,Downtown LA sees cases of flea-borne typhus.,"County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis announced this week that although typhus can occur throughout the county, several cases have occurred in the downtown area. Typhus is a disease caused by bacteria found in infected fleas that can come from many kinds of animals including cats, rats and opossums. Symptoms can include high fever, chills, headaches and rashes. Accumulations of trash that attract animals like rats may increase the risk of exposure. Typhus is treated with antibiotics. It is not transmitted person-to-person.","COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Fall Behind, Causing Concerns for Public Health

As the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic continues, concerns are growing as vaccination rates fall behind in many countries around the world. Despite initial success in vaccine rollout programs, a combination of factors has contributed to a decline in the number of people receiving their shots, which could have serious implications for public health.

One of the primary reasons for the declining vaccination rates is vaccine hesitancy. Misinformation and skepticism surrounding the effectiveness and safety of vaccines have led to a significant portion of the population being reluctant to receive their doses. Conspiracy theories and false claims propagated on social media platforms have created doubt and fear among individuals, even in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of approved vaccines.

Another factor that has hampered vaccination efforts is the unequal distribution of vaccines globally. Wealthier countries have managed to secure large quantities of vaccine supplies, while developing nations struggle to access adequate doses to immunize their populations. This discrepancy in distribution has not only widened global inequality but also poses a threat to the eradication of the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly called for equitable distribution, emphasizing the need for international cooperation in addressing this crisis.

In some regions, logistical challenges have also played a role in the slowing vaccination rates. Limited healthcare infrastructure and difficulties in reaching remote areas have made it harder for authorities to execute mass immunization campaigns efficiently. Additionally, the need for ultra-cold storage conditions for certain vaccines has presented a challenge in rural and low-income areas where such facilities may be lacking.

The decline in vaccination rates is concerning from a public health standpoint. Vaccines have proven to be effective at reducing the severity of symptoms and hospitalizations, as well as preventing the spread of the virus. A delay in achieving widespread vaccination coverage leaves room for new variants of the virus to emerge, potentially undermining the progress made thus far.

Health authorities and governments are ramping up efforts to combat the declining vaccination rates. Public campaigns aimed at debunking vaccine myths, educating the populace on the benefits of vaccination, and addressing concerns have been intensified. Door-to-door vaccination drives and pop-up clinics are being organized in communities that may have difficulty accessing traditional medical facilities.

In addition, various initiatives are underway to address the global vaccine inequality. Wealthier countries have pledged to donate excess doses to lower-income nations, and organizations like COVAX are working towards equitable distribution by providing vaccines to countries in need. However, these efforts need to be expedited to prevent further exacerbation of inequities and by extension, the spread of the virus.

Ultimately, the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic hinges on achieving high vaccination rates. It is imperative for individuals to consult reliable sources, discard misinformation, and make informed decisions about getting vaccinated. As public health agencies work diligently to overcome barriers, it is crucial for citizens to step forward and do their part in ensuring the safety and well-being of themselves and the wider community. The battle against COVID-19 is not over, and now, more than ever, we must remain committed to defeating this global threat together.",true
6938,"About 15,000 strike at University of California hospitals.","The workers that included radiology technicians, respiratory therapists and pharmacy workers picketed the medical centers in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Irvine and Davis. They rang bells, wore green-shirts and carried signed that said “End Outsourcing.” Another 24,000 other California union workers, ranging from truck drivers to gardeners and cooks, were striking in sympathy, said John de los Angeles, spokesman for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299. Emergency rooms remained open at the hospitals but officials said the strike would still affect thousands of patients. The UC San Francisco hospital rescheduled more than 4,000 appointments at its medical center and two associated clinics and rescheduled 241 surgeries, including “pretty high-risk” gynecological and colorectal operations, said chief operating officer Sheila Antrum. Ten patients, including children, were sent to other hospitals, she said. The hospital had 500 temporary employee replacements on hand, including respiratory therapists, social workers, pharmacists and housekeepers, she said. “My focus here is that we get through everything with the usual great care we have,” she said. The union said some of its workers would keep working despite the strike to ensure patient safety, and it also has a “patient protection task force,” a group of emergency services staffers who are prepared to cross the picket lines if they are needed to work because of a medical crisis, de los Angeles said. Patient care workers have been without a contract since December. Talks and mediation efforts have stalled, and the university plans to impose new employment terms next month, de los Angeles said. The union wants the university to stop outsourcing low-wage work that it claims is fueling widening income, racial and gender gaps for workers at UC’s hospitals, clinics campuses and research facilities. The same issue prompted a three-day walkout by 53,000 UC workers last May, including custodians and cafeteria workers. Nurses and other medical workers walked out then in sympathy. “They’re destroying what were once career pathways to the middle-class for our state’s diverse population and are damaging the quality of service that we provide to students, patients, and everyday Californians,” Monica De Leon, vice president of AFSCME Local 3299′s Patient Care Technical Unit, said in a statement. A University of California statement said union leaders spread false information about outside service contracts and that the number of unionized patient care workers increased nearly 19 percent over the past five years while outsourcing contracts had stayed relatively flat. The employment deal to be implemented next month would grant 3-percent-a-year raises for the next 4 years for patient care and service staff, as well as offering a health plan at the same rates as other UC employees with similar salaries. The union, however, is demanding an “unrealistic and unreasonable” 8 percent annual wage increase that is nearly triple what other UC employees have received, UC Office of the President spokeswoman Claire Doan said in a statement. The statement accused union leaders of “throwing a tantrum ... putting their agenda above the needs of patients, students and the public.” But de los Angeles, the union spokesman, said the new employment terms do nothing to deal with the threat of replacing union jobs with cheaper outside contractors who are ill-paid and lack benefits. “What good is a raise if our job is allowed to be outsourced tomorrow?” he said.","New Variant of COVID-19 Discovered in South Africa Sparks Concerns

A new variant of the coronavirus, named B.1.1.529, has been discovered in South Africa, causing increased concerns among health experts and governments around the world. This latest development has raised questions about the effectiveness of current COVID-19 vaccines and the potential ramifications for the global fight against the pandemic.

The B.1.1.529 variant was first identified by South African scientists on November 24th, with initial reports suggesting that it may possess an unusually high number of mutations compared to previous strains. In a press conference, Health Minister Joe Phaahla stated that this newly detected variant is labeled as a ""variant of concern"" due to these numerous mutations and its potential impact on transmissibility and immune evasion.

While extensive research is still being conducted to determine the specific characteristics of this variant, preliminary data indicates that B.1.1.529 shares certain similarities with other variants, such as Delta and Beta, that have previously caused widespread outbreaks. According to experts, the main cause for concern lies in the presence of multiple mutations on the spike protein of the virus, which could potentially affect the effectiveness of current vaccines and make it more transmissible.

The discovery of this variant has led several countries, including Australia, Israel, Germany, and the Netherlands, to swiftly impose travel restrictions and suspend flights from South Africa and neighboring countries. Authorities fear that the rapid spread of this new variant could jeopardize efforts to control the pandemic and lead to a surge in cases globally.

In response to the emergence of B.1.1.529, pharmaceutical companies and health officials are assessing whether existing vaccines and treatments will offer sufficient protection against this new variant. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other relevant institutions have called for a thorough investigation into its characteristics and potential risks.

Despite the uncertainties surrounding this variant, health authorities urge the public to remain calm and emphasize the importance of adhering to preventive measures, such as mask-wearing, hand hygiene, and vaccination. Vaccination is crucial in reducing the severity of the disease and preventing hospitalizations and deaths caused by COVID-19. Health experts emphasize that the existing vaccines have been effective against known variants and continue to provide significant protection against severe illness.

Scientists across the globe are working diligently to study the new variant's transmissibility, severity, and impact on immunity. The South African government has pledged to share all available data on B.1.1.529 with international health organizations and research institutions to ensure a coordinated global response and control its potential spread.

Amidst concerns about the possible implications of this new variant, it is essential to remember that COVID-19 remains primarily a respiratory illness, and the basic preventive measures are effective in avoiding transmission. Vigilance and adherence to public health guidelines are crucial in containing the virus and limiting the impact of any emerging variants on communities worldwide. As scientists and researchers delve into understanding the characteristics of B.1.1.529, the global public health community remains dedicated to protecting lives and minimizing the impact of this ongoing pandemic.",true
7778,U.S. to help South Korea get flu drugs to North despite stalled nuclear talks.,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to work toward denuclearization at a landmark summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in June but the two sides have made little progress. North Korea raised new doubts about a nuclear agreement on Thursday when its state media said any deal on it giving up its nuclear arsenal had to include the complete elimination of U.S. “nuclear threats”. While the United States and North Korea joust over a nuclear deal, South Korea is keen to improve ties with its old rival and has been taking steps to establish links in various areas including transport and humanitarian assistance. There has been some U.S. concern that the South may be moving too quickly on building such links, given the scant progress on denuclearization. Despite that, Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea, said on Wednesday as he arrived in South Korea for talks that he would be looking with aid groups at how to deliver “appropriate assistance” to the North, particularly in the winter. South Korea’s special representative for Korean peace and security affairs, Lee Do-hoon, said after talks with Biegun on Thursday the United States agreed to help supply the North with the flu drug Tamiflu. “The issue of providing Tamiflu to the North Korean people was resolved,” Lee told reporters. South Korea provided 500,000 doses of Tamiflu to the North in 2009 following an outbreak of H1N1 influenza. The Red Cross said in January this year that more than 81,000 North Koreans were affected by the same virus also known as swine flu. Humanitarian aid is not subject to tough sanctions on North Korea aimed at pressing it to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. But officials at U.N. agencies and aid groups have told Reuters that their operations have nearly ground to a halt because of the strict interpretation of U.N. curbs on banking and shipping to North Korea, as well as a travel ban for U.S. citizens. Lee said he had secured U.S. sanctions exemptions over a plan to reconnect rail and road links, as well as the joint excavation of remains of soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean War in the Demilitarised Zone, which is administered by the U.S.-led United Nations Command. Biegun said while the United States had no intention of easing sanctions, such cooperation could help advance the nuclear diplomacy. “Of course, all of this is intended to advance what we’re trying to do with North Korea,” Biegun told reporters. “Now that work begins with denuclearization but also includes the strong commitments by both of our countries to transform relations and build a permanent peace regime on the Korean peninsula,” he said. Trump has said a second summit with Kim was likely in January or February, though he wrote on Twitter last week that he was “in no hurry”. Biegun said the United States and North Korea had yet to agree on a date or venue for a second summit, but would work for an “agreeable outcome”. “We’re eager to move to the next stage of discussions with our North Korean partners,” he said.","New Study Shows COVID-19 Vaccine Provides Strong Protection Against Severe Illness and Hospitalization

A recent study has shown promising results regarding the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe illness and hospitalization. The study, conducted by a team of researchers from leading institutions, offers further evidence that getting vaccinated is crucial in the fight against the ongoing global pandemic.

The research focused on analyzing data from over one million individuals who had received different COVID-19 vaccines. The findings revealed a significant reduction in the risk of severe illness and hospitalization among those who had been fully vaccinated. This evidence highlights the importance of vaccination as a critical tool in reducing the burden on healthcare systems and saving lives.

The study found that individuals who were fully vaccinated had an approximately 90% lower risk of being hospitalized due to COVID-19 compared to those who were unvaccinated. Moreover, the likelihood of experiencing severe illness was reduced by up to 80% in vaccinated individuals. These numbers provide strong reassurance about the protective benefits of the vaccines currently available.

Dr. Emily Thompson, the lead researcher of the study, emphasized the importance of these findings, stating, ""Our research demonstrates that getting vaccinated significantly reduces the chances of severe outcomes associated with COVID-19. It is vital for individuals to get vaccinated not only to protect themselves but also to safeguard their communities."" Dr. Thompson's statements echo the sentiment shared by numerous public health officials and experts worldwide.

The study also examined whether the efficacy varied across different COVID-19 variants. Encouragingly, the vaccines provided substantial protection even against emerging variants of concern. While some breakthrough infections were observed, they were milder and less likely to result in hospitalization or severe illness.

These findings arrive at a critical time when many countries are facing new waves of COVID-19 cases driven by more transmissible variants. Despite some initial concerns about variant resistance, the study's results strongly suggest that the current vaccines remain highly effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization.

Dr. Michael Rodriguez, a public health expert, stresses the significance of these findings for shaping public health policies. ""We now have robust evidence that the vaccines protect against severe outcomes. Governments should prioritize increasing vaccine coverage to prevent overwhelming healthcare systems during these challenging times,"" he remarked.

The study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting vaccination campaigns worldwide. Vaccination efforts have already had a significant impact on reducing COVID-19 cases, allowing societies to regain some sense of normalcy. However, there are still many eligible individuals who remain unvaccinated due to various factors such as hesitancy or limited access. The study's results serve as an important reminder to prioritize and accelerate vaccination campaigns to reach as many people as possible.

In conclusion, the recent study brings encouraging news about the protective benefits of COVID-19 vaccines. The research demonstrates that vaccinations significantly reduce the risk of severe illness and hospitalization and are effective against emerging variants of concern. These findings provide strong evidence to support ongoing vaccination campaigns as an essential strategy to combat the pandemic and save lives.",true
2299,Ukraine conflict hampers recovery of sick children.,"Now, after five months of shelling in and around her hometown of Yasynuvata, a strategic rail hub that has changed hands several times during the conflict, her condition has deteriorated as stress has stiffened her muscles and crippled her posture. She can no longer stand unsupported. “Kids like Maria are much more afraid than others,” said Maria’s grandmother Tamara, who brought the girl through fighting and roadblocks for treatment in Donetsk, the region’s largest city and now the separatists’ main stronghold. “All this bombing has pushed her recovery back by about a year and a half,” she said, cradling Maria in her arms. Maria is among about 30 young patients undergoing treatment in the half-full Donetsk clinic which specializes in children’s neurological disorders. It is now awaiting the arrival of a boy who needs to learn how to walk again after sustaining shrapnel wounds that damaged his spine. He is one of the more than 8,700 people to have been wounded in the conflict which erupted in east Ukraine in April and which has so far killed more than 3,660 people, according to the United Nations. Many schools, hospitals and other public institutions are closed after being hit by shelling or because of nearby fighting that has meant it is too dangerous to continue operating. The clinic also suffers from an acute shortage of money in rebel-held territory, where many public-sector workers no longer receive salaries from Kiev and the separatists’ self-proclaimed “Donetsk People’s Republic” (DNR) has virtually no resources to make up for the shortfall. “I treat children and that requires money, whether they come from Ukraine yesterday or the DNR tomorrow. We just need to keep going,” said the clinic’s director, Oleg Yevtushenko. “And I don’t ask my staff who they are backing (in the conflict). We need to work for the children and that’s it.”    On his desk lies a pile of papers prepared for when he is required to register his clinic and staff under the DNR rather than Ukraine. “For now, the DNR has nowhere to take money from, they first need to start collecting taxes. I am ready to register as required but I need to know there will be money for us,” said Yevtushenko. He said the Ukrainian authorities were still covering the clinic’s utility bills and, after a break, had paid his staff’s salaries for July, August and half of September. But the future remains very uncertain, despite a fragile ceasefire - marred by sporadic shelling - which has broadly held across the region now for more than a month. The crisis in east Ukraine, which has affected the lives of many civilians, has dragged ties between Russia and the West to new lows. The West has imposed economic sanctions on Russia for what it sees as Moscow’s role in fanning the separatist unrest and supporting the rebels with arms and troops. Moscow accuses Kiev of mistreating the mainly Russian-speaking region of east Ukraine but denies playing a role in the conflict, despite evidence to the contrary cited by human rights campaigners and groups representing Russian soldiers’ families. In Yasynuvata, the fighting often left Maria and her grandmother without electricity, enough food or medicines. Maria has grown to fear the sound of shelling and men wearing military camouflage, widely used by both sides in the conflict. Even in the clinic she has not been able to forget the war. One day, she got a shock when a rebel fighter wearing dark-green camouflage uniform walked in. It turned out he was visiting his wife and their heavily disabled baby daughter, who was being treated next to Maria. “When Stephanya was born, she was unresponsive, everyone told us she would die,” said her mother Viktoria, holding her daughter wrapped in a white shawl. “But she is with us and we are treating her here. From the tone of her voice I can now tell what she needs from me.”  The family lives in the town of Yenakievo where, before the conflict, Viktoria ran a shop and her husband was a miner. Born prematurely, Stephanya is very small for her one year and three months of age. Her mother has tears in her eyes when she talks of her husband fighting, but she hopes it may allow them to get better treatment for Stephanya in Moscow. “He sometimes comes home to wash his uniform. But since he joined the ranks of DNR fighters, that makes me a DNR supporter as well, I guess,” she said. “Yes, I hope we will live better than under Kiev and I hope we will be an independent state but, honestly, most of all I hope my daughter gets better.”","New Study Suggests COVID-19 Vaccines Remain Effective Against New Variants

As the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic continues, concerns have grown over the emergence of new variants that could potentially render existing vaccines less effective. However, a recent study conducted by researchers at a leading medical institute offers some reassuring findings, suggesting that current vaccines remain highly effective against these new variants.

The study focused on three prominent variants currently spreading across the globe: Alpha variant, first identified in the UK; Beta variant, first identified in South Africa; and Gamma variant, first identified in Brazil. These variants have shown to possess genetic mutations that make them potentially more transmissible and resistant to vaccine-induced immunity.

To assess the effectiveness of the vaccines against these variants, the researchers collected blood samples from individuals who had received either two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. They then exposed the samples to live virus strains representing each of the studied variants.

The results of the study were promising. The neutralizing antibodies present in the blood samples displayed strong activity against all three variants, although the efficacy varied slightly among them. Against the Alpha variant, the vaccines showed a roughly 94% reduction in neutralization activity compared to the initial strain. When it came to the Beta and Gamma variants, the reduction was somewhat steeper, at approximately 88%. Despite these small decreases, the vaccines still elicited a robust immune response capable of neutralizing the variants.

Dr. Sarah Thompson, the lead researcher involved in the study, expressed her optimism about these findings. ""Our results suggest that the current vaccines are holding up well against these concerning variants,"" she stated. ""While there is a slight decline in neutralization activity, it is not significant enough to cause major concern.""

These results align with previous studies that have assessed the efficacy of various COVID-19 vaccines against emerging variants. Public health organizations and vaccine manufacturers continue to monitor these variants closely and adapt vaccine formulations as needed to ensure continued protection against evolving strains.

Dr. Michael Collins, a renowned infectious disease expert, emphasized the importance of vaccination in controlling the spread of the virus. ""These findings reinforce the significance of achieving high vaccination rates globally,"" he stated. ""The more people we can vaccinate, the less opportunity the virus has to mutate and develop new variants.""

While the study provided valuable insights into the efficacy of current vaccines against these specific variants, it does not rule out the possibility of future variants that may pose greater challenges. Experts stress the need for ongoing surveillance, rapid variant identification, and the development of new vaccine strategies to tackle any potential threats.

In conclusion, the findings from this recent study provide reassurance that currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines remain effective against the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants. Vaccinated individuals can feel confident that they have substantial protection against these strains, despite the slight decline in neutralization activity. However, as the virus continues to evolve, sustained efforts in vaccination, surveillance, and research remain paramount in overcoming this global health crisis.",true

And instead of focusing just on a narrow slice of cuts that they were demanding, we were able to expand the area of cuts and prevent some (in the budget deal). So that's good news."""" We wondered whether Van Hollen was right when he said that """"the Republicans have demanded deep cuts in education. They've demanded cuts in cancer research and other research to find cures and treatments to diseases."""" Van Hollen's remarks were based on H.R. 1, a fiscal year 2011 spending bill that passed the House but was rejected by the Senate in a 44-56 vote on March 9, 2011. We’re using it because it was a virtually pure Republican proposal: Only three Republicans voted against it on the floor, and no Democrats voted for it. So, would these programs be cut under H.R. 1? The answer is yes. Here are some of the key areas:  • Title I education spending. This is a program that sends federal funds to the states for K-12 education. H.R. 1 would have cut Title I spending by $693.5 million compared to the amount enacted for fiscal year 2010. • Part B IDEA grants. This program provides federal funding for special education based on a formula. H.R. 1 would have cut Part B spending by $557.7 million compared to the fiscal year 2010 level. • Pell grants. This program funds low-income individuals pursuing undergraduate or sometimes graduate degrees. H.R. 1 would have capped the size of Pell grants for the 2011-12 award year at $4,015. Once that amount is adjusted for an additional sum provided under mandatory funding, the maximum level for Pell grants would be $845 lower than today’s level. • Head Start. This program provides low-income children of preschool age with child-development programs that teach skills that prepare them for school. H.R. 1 would have cut Head Start, which is run by the Department of Health and Human Servcies, by a little under $1.1 billion. • National Institutes of Heath. NIH is the leading federal institution for conducting research on disease treatments. H.R. 1 would have cut its general budget back to 2008 levels, amounting to a reduction of $639.5 million from fiscal year 2010. In congressional testimony on March 11, 2011, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that the proposed cuts would mean that """"about half of the hundred largest clinical studies including those on cancer and Alzheimer's would probably be canceled."""" When we spoke to Boehner’s office, they didn’t counter the notion that these areas would have been cut if H.R. 1 had been enacted. """"In H.R. 1, we did cut IDEA, Head Start, Title I, Pell grants and NIH,"""" said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner. """"The cuts were across all accounts. Nothing was off limits."""" Of course, Republicans have emphasized broader aspects of their bill. In a Feb. 12, 2011, news release about the introduction of H.R. 1, Boehner spoke generally about cutting spending and reducing the size of government, and didn’t mention education and disease research. The statement issued the same day by Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., didn’t get specific, either. And in a Feb. 15, 2011, floor speech about the bill, House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., didn’t mention those programs either. The specific programs he cited were elimination of previous earmark funding from fiscal 2010 and the rescinding of unobligated funding from the stimulus bill. None of this is remotely surprising -- in the abstract, education and disease research tend to be popular programs. One would expect Republican leaders to play up the more popular aspects of the bill, such as taming the deficit and reducing the size of government, rather than the less popular ones. By the same token, it's not surprising that Van Hollen highlighted the budget’s impact on education and disease research. It’s the latest incarnation of the old political war-cry that your opponent is targeting widows, orphans and other helpless Americans. But that’s not the whole story. H.R. 1 aimed to cut discretionary spending by $100 billion -- including loads of cuts that had nothing to do with education or disease research. We do think Van Hollen’s underlying point -- that cuts were made to education and disease research -- is valid. Reasonable people can disagree on whether such cuts are justified, but Van Hollen is well within his rights to point out that these programs would be cut under H.R. 1, just as Republicans are well within their rights to argue that the deficit is so large that every federal program needs to give up some funding. Ultimately, the voters will decide whose priorities hold sway. In our view, Van Hollen has narrowed the Republicans’ bill, which includes wide-ranging cuts, to just two popular programs. On the other hand, he’s right that those programs would take budget hits under the bill.""","COVID-19 Vaccines Show Promising Results: A Step Towards Ending the Pandemic

As the world battles the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a glimmer of hope has emerged in the form of vaccines. In recent months, pharmaceutical companies have made significant progress in developing effective vaccines to combat the virus that has wreaked havoc across the globe.

Pioneering vaccine developers such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have recently announced promising results from their clinical trials, raising expectations for an eventual end to this devastating health crisis. Both companies have reported vaccine efficacy rates of around 95%, marking a major breakthrough in defeating the virus.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, developed in collaboration between the American and German companies, was the first to receive emergency use authorization in multiple countries. Utilizing messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, this vaccine stimulates the body's immune response to produce antibodies tailored to fight off the virus. The vaccine has demonstrated high efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 cases, allowing governments to plan massive vaccination campaigns.

Similarly, the Moderna vaccine has proved to be equally promising. Using mRNA technology like its Pfizer-BioNTech counterpart, the Moderna vaccine has shown a 94% efficacy rate in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 cases in the phase three trial. The company has also reported the vaccine's success in curbing severe illness related to the virus, further reinforcing its potential impact on public health.

These remarkable vaccine developments offer renewed optimism amidst the relentless struggle against the pandemic. Scientists and policymakers alike recognize the significance of these vaccines in mitigating the devastating effects of COVID-19. However, challenges lie ahead in ensuring global distribution and administration of the vaccines and addressing concerns raised by skeptics.

One of the primary challenges faced is manufacturing and distributing the vaccines on an unprecedented scale. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines require ultra-cold storage and transportation, posing logistical hurdles in ensuring widespread availability. Governments and health organizations are working tirelessly to establish cold-chain infrastructure and distribution networks capable of delivering the vaccines efficiently.

Moreover, addressing public concerns about the safety and efficacy of these vaccines is crucial for their success. Despite rigorous testing and approval processes, vaccine hesitancy persists among some individuals. Transparency and comprehensive communication campaigns are essential to build trust and provide accurate information on the vaccines' tested effectiveness and minimal side effects.

Ensuring equitable access to vaccines is another critical aspect on the road to ending the pandemic. Wealthier nations have secured advance purchase agreements with pharmaceutical companies, potentially leaving poorer countries at a disadvantage. Efforts are underway to establish programs such as COVAX, led by organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the World Health Organization, to address these disparities and ensure global access to vaccines.

While these vaccines offer hope for an eventual return to normalcy, it is important to remember that they are not an immediate panacea. Vaccination campaigns take time, and until a significant portion of the population is immunized, preventive measures such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing will remain necessary.

In conclusion, the recent breakthroughs in COVID-19 vaccine development bring much-needed optimism in the fight against the pandemic. The high efficacy rates demonstrated by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mark a significant milestone in our journey towards ending this crisis. However, challenges such as distribution logistics, building trust, and ensuring global equity must be addressed promptly. As the world pulls together to combat the virus, the hope for a brighter future grows stronger, offering a light at the end of an arduous tunnel.",true
12017,I personally am pro-choice. I always have been. And I made no qualms about that when I was elected governor.,"""Gov. Bruce Rauner’s signing of a controversial abortion bill last month triggered an avalanche of protest from his fellow Illinois Republicans and anti-abortion groups, who said he had betrayed them. The bill, House Bill 40, removed a """"trigger provision"""" in Illinois law that would have made abortion illegal should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe vs. Wade. It also made abortion eligible for coverage under Medicaid in Illinois and under the state’s employee health insurance plan. Opponents were angry that Rauner broke a promise he made five months earlier to veto the bill because of its Medicaid and insurance component, which for the first time would use state taxpayer funds to pay for abortion outside of cases of rape or incest or to protect the life of the mother. They also claimed Rauner reneged on a campaign pledge that he had """"no social agenda,"""" which they interpreted as Rauner having no plans to change the state’s abortion laws. In a Sept. 28 press conference in which he announced his intent to sign the bill, Rauner lamented that he could not convince Democratic lawmakers to split the legislation into separate bills, one covering the trigger provision and the other dealing with insurance coverage. But he defended his action as consistent with his pro-choice principles. """"I personally am pro-choice. I always have been. And I made no qualms about that when I was elected governor,"""" Rauner said. Rauner’s statement sent us combing through video clips, ads and news coverage of the 2014 gubernatorial election to see if he really was consistent in presenting his pro-choice stance to voters during that hotly contested race. Here’s what we found. Rauner, a wealthy private equity investor who had never run for elected office, sought to build his campaign solely on economic, educational and political reform issues. He stated often that he had no social agenda, and his wife, Diana, appeared in a campaign ad making that very statement. This helped Rauner avoid taking a direct stand on same-sex marriage, which was a hot topic in Illinois politics in the months preceding the 2014 GOP primary for governor. In May 2013, just before Rauner formally declared his candidacy, longtime state GOP chairman Pat Brady resigned in part because of fallout from him having declared his support for same-sex marriage. Rauner’s no-social-agenda claim also proved useful when it came to navigating the political minefield of abortion. To win election in a Democratic-leaning state, Rauner needed to get votes from Democrats who support abortion rights and moderate Republicans without antagonizing social conservatives. """"My opponent is desperate for social issues to become prominent in the campaign,"""" Rauner said in a campaign appearance with his running mate, Evelyn Sanguinetti, in June 2014. """"And I’ve been crystal clear: I do not have a social agenda. Evelyn and I are not running on social issues. We all have our personal beliefs. We are not advocating leading on social issues, we are fine with the status quo on that."""" That said, we found several examples in which Rauner explained his position on access to abortion during the campaign. In an appearance before Wauconda Township Republicans on Oct. 2, 2013, Rauner said: """"Abortion is a tragedy. It’s a loss of life. To me that’s not debatable. However, I do not advocate making it illegal. I can’t, I won’t, I’m not going to talk about making it illegal. I’m going to work and support efforts to make it safe and rare. Parental notification, late-term restrictions, teaching abstinence outside of marriage and strongly encouraging adoption as a far better alternative."""" To residents of HeatherRidge community in Gurnee on Nov. 3, 2013: """"The reality is the right for a woman to choose is the national law and we’re not gonna, that ain’t gonna change in Illinois. I think we can agree on some common-sense ways where abortion can be more rare and safe. I support parental notification. I support late-term restrictions. I strongly encourage adoption as a far better alternative to abortion. There are things we can agree on to work on to try and get done, realistically… """"I just think it’s better for a woman and her physician and her family and her minister or priest make the decision than the government. That’s my view. People can disagree with me. I respect that. But that’s my view, it ain’t gonna change."""" It came up in an interview on the """"Big John and Amy Show"""" on WIND-AM 560 on March 17, 2014: Amy Jacobson: """"If there was a possibility that the decision was passed from federal to state jurisdiction, what would your position be?"""" Rauner: """"My position would be abortion is a tragedy but it should be an issue left to a woman with her physician and her family and her minister, not the government."""" It wasn’t just the candidate himself proclaiming his """"pro-choice"""" bona fides during the campaign. Diana Rauner, head of the child advocacy concern the Ounce of Prevention Fund, became a strong spokeswoman for her husband’s no-social-agenda agenda, especially where it concerned reproductive rights. """"You can trust him that there’s no way he will ever let anything happen to our reproductive rights,"""" Diana Rauner said in an interview with NBC5 political reporter Mary Ann Ahern on Sept. 26, 2014. """"I actually think this is a great opportunity in this race where we actually don’t have to think about the social issues because both candidates are pro-choice."""" The campaign featured a 30-second TV ad in which Diana, who claimed to be a Democrat,  sought to bring Democrats to her husband’s side by telling viewers, """"Bruce doesn't have a social agenda. He has an economic and educational agenda."""" After an Oct. 24, 2014, event in Chicago in which feminist icon Gloria Steinem endorsed Quinn and accused Rauner of financially supporting anti-abortion causes and candidates. """"In terms of money and action, he is, in fact, anti-choice,"""" Steinem said during her appearance with Quinn. Diana Rauner provided the response in an interview with then ABC-7 political reporter Charles Thomas. """"Bruce has a strong history of being a supporter of reproductive rights,"""" she said. """"He’s a social moderate and he’s committed to education and has shown that commitment over the years."""" Throughout the campaign, Rauner found himself in the strange position of being a Republican candidate forced to deny charges that he opposed abortion. Despite Rauner’s many statements to the contrary, the Quinn campaign sought to portray Rauner as a major funder of anti-abortion candidates and organizations. The Chicago Tribune story on Steinem’s appearance carried this rebuttal from Rauner’s campaign: """"Rauner campaign aides said the candidate and wife Diana have donated money to abortion rights groups including Planned Parenthood and the Roger Baldwin Foundation."""" The Baldwin Foundation is a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union that litigates issues including reproductive rights. At the same time, however, Rauner was a heavy donor to Republican candidates and state and national Republican organizations that were firmly in the anti-abortion camp. Chicago Magazine detailed the political/ideological conflict of the Rauners in an article published the day before the 2014 election headlined, """"Is Bruce Rauner Pro-Choice, Anti-Choice, or Just an Opportunist?"""" (I)t’s interesting to look at the self-proclaimed Democrat, Diana, who has given in 2014 the max in the primary and/or general to several Republicans, some who are decidedly not socially moderate...  Just a couple of examples: David McSweeney (abortion and gay marriage opponent), Mark Neerhof (against gay marriage). Diana has also given generously ($10,000 in 2012; $5,300 this time around) to the Republican Renaissance PAC of the late ultra-conservative Jack Roeser (anti abortion, anti gay marriage). Bruce has a much more extensive record of contributions—including $27.6 million to himself, $5 million to the state Republican party, and also, along with Diana, donations to McSweeney, Neerhof, and to Roeser’s PAC. (Roeser, who died last June, was an early Rauner backer and a member of his gubernatorial exploratory committee.) Considering the contradictory nature of the Rauners’ donations -- giving heavily to groups that support abortion rights and also to political candidates and organizations that oppose them -- it’s reasonable to believe that some anti-abortion voters might have inferred anti-abortion leanings in candidate Rauner. But we found no evidence of Rauner himself attempting to hide his  stance. In 2014, campaigning on maintaining the status quo on abortion was a viable option. State finances were a wreck and there appeared to be little pressure either way to change the state’s laws on abortion. The election of Donald Trump, who stated an intent to overturn Roe v. Wade and turn the question of abortion’s legality back to the states, changed that overnight. Almost immediately, Democrats in the Illinois General Assembly began advancing a bill to both keep abortion legal should Roe v. Wade be overturned and provide insurance coverage for it under Medicaid and Illinois’ state employee health insurance. """"I look at it as an insurance parity issue. There’s no excuse about the cost,"""" Rep. Sara Feigenholtz, D-Chicago, said in December 2016. By packaging the trigger language and the expanded insurance coverage into a single bill, supporters of what became HB 40 effectively boxed Rauner by forcing the no-social-agenda governor to pick a side in the culture wars. He would infuriate pro-choice voters by either vetoing the bill outright or issuing an amendatory veto to strike the abortion insurance provision, the practical effect of which would be to kill the measure anyway. But signing HB 40 would be sure to antagonize much his Republican base, much of which remains passionately opposed to abortion. This was something Rauner had worked throughout the spring to avoid, at times sending out mixed signals about how he intended to handle the bill if lawmakers sent it to his desk. He made public statements in April promising to veto the bill as written. When he broke that promise, he faced the wrath of everyone from rank-and-file Republican lawmakers to Chicago Cardinal Blaise Cupich. Rauner, speaking haltingly and appearing physically uncomfortable, explained at his signing press conference that adding government funded insurance coverage was consistent with his pro-choice beliefs. """"I also believe that no woman should be forced to make a different decision than another woman make purely based on her income,"""" Rauner said. """"I believe that a woman living with limited financial means should not be put in a position where she has to choose something different than a woman of higher income would be able to choose."""" Bruce Rauner said his signing of a controversial abortion bill was consistent with his pro-choice principles and that he had never presented himself as anything but pro-choice. We looked through numerous campaign appearance videos, ads and news stories and found no evidence that Rauner ever tried to hide or downplay his pro-choice beliefs. In fact, his campaign touted the Rauners’ support of abortion rights groups to rebut the charge that he was not pro-choice. Rauner sought anti-abortion voters by assuring them that, as governor, he had no social agenda and that """"the right for a woman to choose is the national law and… that ain’t gonna change in Illinois."""" Politically, it proved to be a smart strategy that helped gain him election in 2014. By 2017, however, it became impossible to continue finessing the issue. In picking a side, Rauner declared that he has been consistent in declaring his pro-choice beliefs.""","New Study Finds COVID-19 Vaccines Highly Effective in Preventing Severe Illness and Hospitalization

A recent study conducted by leading health experts has revealed that COVID-19 vaccines are exceptionally effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization. The findings have significantly paved the way for a speeding up of vaccination campaigns worldwide, giving hope to people exhausted by the relentless impact of the pandemic.

The study, which analyzed data from over 50 countries, highlighted the remarkable effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing severe outcomes among individuals who contracted the virus. According to the research, people who received the recommended dosage of vaccine were significantly less likely to be hospitalized or require intensive care as compared to those who remained unvaccinated.

Dr. Sarah Thompson, one of the researchers involved in the study, emphasized the importance of these findings in combating the ongoing pandemic. ""Our research clearly demonstrates the substantial benefits of COVID-19 vaccines,"" she stated. ""Not only do they protect against infection, but they also play a vital role in minimizing the severity of the disease if breakthrough infections occur.""

The study also explored the impact of different vaccine types and found that all authorized vaccines exhibited high levels of efficacy in preventing severe illness. This suggests that regardless of the vaccine chosen, individuals can have confidence in its ability to provide significant protection against severe outcomes.

While breakthrough infections can still occur among vaccinated individuals, the study highlighted that the vast majority of these cases resulted in mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. This is a crucial finding that reinforces the importance of getting vaccinated to reduce the burden on healthcare systems overwhelmed by severe COVID-19 cases.

Furthermore, the research indicated that the risk of hospitalization was notably higher among unvaccinated individuals compared to those who had received their shots. This observation underscores the urgent need for comprehensive vaccination campaigns to reach as many people as possible, particularly those who have not yet taken steps to get vaccinated.

Experts believe that disseminating these findings widely can help increase vaccine uptake and combat vaccine hesitancy, which remains a significant obstacle in some communities. The study's results confirm that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh any perceived risks and provide concrete evidence of the vaccines' effectiveness against severe illness and hospitalization.

Health authorities have welcomed the study's conclusions, emphasizing that getting vaccinated continues to be the most powerful tool in the fight against COVID-19. Dr. Emma Ramirez, a leading epidemiologist, remarked, ""The findings clearly show that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective and offer a way out of this pandemic if we all work together to get vaccinated.""

As countries continue their efforts to ramp up vaccination rates, public health officials are hopeful that these new findings will encourage more people to take the crucial step of getting vaccinated. For a true return to normalcy, achieving high vaccination coverage is essential in reducing severe outcomes, protecting vulnerable populations, and ultimately curbing the spread of the virus.

In conclusion, the latest study underscores the remarkable effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe illness and hospitalization. As the world battles with ongoing waves of infections, this research reinforces the urgent need for widespread vaccination campaigns to protect individuals and alleviate pressure on healthcare systems. The findings provide clear evidence that vaccination is a crucial step towards overcoming the devastating impact of the pandemic and restoring a sense of normalcy to communities around the globe.",true
2907,Medtronic's novel hypertension device fails in trials.,"The device, known as renal denervation system, is aimed at high blood pressure-patients who are resistant to traditional drug therapies and works by deadening nerves in kidneys. Analysts called the trial results disappointing, even though they did not have very high sales expectations from the device. “The impact of this news on Medtronic should be modest as we only model worldwide revenues (from the device) of ... 1.2 percent of total company sales in 2018,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst Larry Biegelsen wrote in a note. However, despite meeting its main safety goal in the trial, Medtronic said it would halt ongoing trials of the device in the United States, Japan and India. The device was launched in Europe in April 2010, but its adoption was slow as austere governments were reluctant to pay for the unconventional technology. Several other medical device makers, including St Jude Medical Inc and Covidien, are also making devices aimed at treating high blood pressure. These devices work by creating tiny scars along nerves in the kidneys - organs that play a pivotal role in regulating blood pressure by sending signals to the brain that can cause blood vessels to constrict. This scarring process is carried out by threading a catheter through the renal arteries from the groin. It deadens the nerves and decreases blood pressure. Medtronic shares were down 2.5 percent at $59.29 in late morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. They touched a low of $57.92 earlier in the session.","COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts Show Promise in Curbing the Pandemic

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination efforts have stepped up, bringing hope for a brighter future. With multiple vaccines being developed and authorized for emergency use, countries globally strive to ramp up their immunization campaigns to benefit their populations.

In recent months, vaccine production has soared, enabling governments to expand their rollout plans. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, both based on mRNA technology, have demonstrated high efficacy rates. These breakthroughs have bolstered confidence in the scientific community and raised hopes that these vaccines will play an instrumental role in ending the pandemic.

The vaccination campaigns began with frontline healthcare workers and the elderly, prioritizing those most at risk. This strategy aims to reduce severe illness and mortality rates while safeguarding essential healthcare systems. Many countries have also adopted a phased approach, gradually expanding eligibility to reach the wider population.

Early data suggest that the vaccines are effective in preventing infection, severe disease, and hospitalization, providing reassurance for both individuals and healthcare systems. Studies show that vaccinated individuals have a significantly lower risk of falling severely ill due to COVID-19, even in face of emerging variants.

Another encouraging aspect is the global distribution of vaccines, with numerous countries collaborating to ensure equitable access. Programs such as COVAX, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), aim to deliver vaccines to low-income countries. This initiative recognizes the urgency of vaccinating everyone around the world to bring an end to the pandemic, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and fair distribution.

In addition to the mRNA vaccines, other vaccine candidates are also showing promise. AstraZeneca's vaccine, developed in collaboration with the University of Oxford, has  demonstrated effectiveness in reducing illness and hospitalizations, despite concerns about its overall efficacy. Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine has also received authorization, offering hope for increased accessibility and efficiency in vaccination campaigns.

However, challenges remain on the road to widespread vaccination. Supply shortages in some regions have slowed down immunization efforts, raising concerns about delays and potential inequities. Addressing these issues requires collaboration between governments, manufacturers, and global health organizations to ensure a steady supply of vaccines worldwide.

Hesitancy and misinformation surrounding COVID-19 vaccines represent another hurdle. Education and awareness campaigns are crucial in dispelling myths, addressing concerns, and boosting public confidence in the vaccine's safety and effectiveness.

Monitoring the long-term effects of the vaccines is also essential to ensure continued safety. Robust post-vaccination surveillance systems are being implemented worldwide to detect any adverse events and provide timely interventions when necessary.

The road ahead still holds uncertainties, with new virus variants emerging and their potential impact on vaccine efficacy yet to be fully understood. Nonetheless, the development and distribution of highly effective vaccines give reason for cautious optimism amidst the ongoing battle against COVID-19.

As vaccination programs advance, it is vital for individuals to stay vigilant and maintain other preventive measures, such as wearing masks, practicing good hygiene, and adhering to social distancing guidelines. Combining these strategies with widespread administration of safe and effective vaccines represents the best path towards ending this devastating global crisis and restoring normalcy to our lives.",true
912,"Malnutrition, disease rising in North Korea: aid organization.","International aid agencies as well as North Korea state media have been warning that erratic weather with drought and floods, and a lack of access to resources could lead to a food crisis in a country under strict international sanctions over leader Kim Jong Un’s pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. “We are already seeing the impacts of this drought on vulnerable people,” Mohamed Babiker, head of the IFRC’s office in North Korea, said in a statement. “Rates of malnutrition and water borne diseases like diarrhea and colitis are on the rise.”  After an assessment in May concluded that this year’s harvest would be less than half what it should be, the IFRC spent 250,000 Swiss francs ($253,787) on deploying mobile water pumps, which were able to double crop yields in the targeted areas, the organization said. “Water pumps and irrigation supplies can make a significant difference,” Babiker said, calling for an additional 472,000 Swiss francs ($479,284) for more agricultural and sanitation supplies. North Korea increased imports of fertilizer and food products last year, according to trade data compiled by the United Nations. But the Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS), a Washington-based think tank, documented in a report this week how North Korea also continues to import millions of dollars worth of luxury goods, including at least two armored limousines valued at $500,000 each. South Korea’s intelligence agency told lawmakers on Tuesday that drought had hit the North Korean economy which already faces difficulties such as widening trade deficits, foreign currency shortages and a deepening cash crunch due to sanctions. Rainfall in North Korea has fallen by more than 30% this year from a year before, and there are signs of a deteriorating food situation, according to Lee Eun-jae, one of the lawmakers briefed by the spy agency. “North Korea is expected to exhaust its crop reserves earlier than usual this year,” Lee told reporters. South Korea has said it would donate $4.5 million to the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP), and announced it was also providing 50,000 tonnes of rice for delivery to its northern neighbor. South Korea also recently donated $3.5 million to the U.N. Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for humanitarian projects in North Korea. Last week, North Korea state news agency KCNA said a campaign to mitigate the effects of drought was under way by digging canals and wells, installing pumps, and using people and vehicles to transport water. The official television broadcaster on Monday warned of further damage in the upcoming rainy season. It said the country suffered from floods in June, showing submerged buildings and villages where houses were destroyed by landslides. Sporadic famines are common in North Korea, according to experts based in South Korea, but in the 1990s, a nationwide famine killed as many as one million people.","New findings suggest that COVID-19 may have long-lasting effects on the heart, even in people who experienced only mild or no symptoms. A study conducted by researchers at the University of Washington revealed that nearly one in four individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 showed evidence of heart damage.

The study involved over 2,500 individuals who had previously contracted and recovered from the virus. Participants underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess their heart health. Shockingly, 23% of them exhibited abnormalities in their heart structure or function. These included inflammation, scarring, and an impaired ability to pump blood efficiently.

Dr. Todd Anderson, a cardiologist not involved in the study, noted that these findings were alarming and suggested that COVID-19 could potentially lead to long-term consequences for cardiovascular health. He emphasized that even seemingly healthy individuals who experienced a milder course of the disease should seek medical evaluation to determine any potential damage to their hearts.

This study is not the first to suggest a link between COVID-19 and heart complications. Previous research has indicated that the viral infection can cause inflammation throughout the body, leading to various organ damage. The heart, being a vital organ responsible for pumping oxygen-rich blood, is particularly susceptible to such damage.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on the heart have been raised. Initially, the focus was primarily on severe cases and people with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. However, emerging evidence suggests that even those with milder symptoms or asymptomatic individuals can experience lasting effects on their heart health.

Researchers believe that the lingering heart damage observed in COVID-19 survivors could be a result of several factors. Firstly, direct viral invasion of heart cells may lead to inflammation and injury. Secondly, the inflammatory response triggered by the immune system's reaction to the virus can also contribute to heart damage. Lastly, the strain placed on the heart due to decreased oxygen levels and increased work of breathing could further exacerbate the issue.

The findings from this study underscore the importance of monitoring and caring for recovered COVID-19 patients, regardless of the severity of their initial illness. As Dr. Anderson highlights, it is crucial to ensure that individuals who have had the virus receive appropriate medical follow-up, including monitoring heart function and assessing any potential long-term consequences.

Cardiologists are urging individuals to report any new or persistent symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following a COVID-19 infection. Seeking medical attention promptly can help identify and address potential heart complications in a timely manner, reducing the risk of more severe outcomes.

While researchers continue to investigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the heart, it is essential for the public to remain vigilant. Following recommended preventive measures such as wearing masks, practicing good hand hygiene, and getting vaccinated when eligible can significantly reduce one's risk of contracting the virus. Additionally, maintaining a healthy lifestyle encompassing regular exercise, a balanced diet, and managing underlying health conditions can help promote heart health and overall well-being during these uncertain times.",true
4235,Cancer group finds biggest one-year drop in U.S. death rate.,"The overall cancer death rate has been falling about 1.5% a year since 1991. It fell 2.2% from 2016 to 2017, according to the new American Cancer Society report. That’s the largest drop ever seen in national cancer statistics going back to 1930, said Rebecca Siegel, the lead author. “It’s absolutely driven by lung cancer,” which accounts for about a quarter of all cancer deaths, she said. Take lung cancer out of the mix, and the 2017 rate drop is 1.4%, she added. Government researchers previously reported a slightly lower drop in the cancer death rate for the same period. But the Cancer Society calculates the death rate differently, and on Wednesday said the decline was larger — and record-setting. Most lung cancer cases are tied to smoking, and decades of declining smoking rates led to falling rates of lung cancer illnesses and deaths. But the drop in deaths seems to have been accelerated by recent lung cancer treatment advances, Siegel said. Experts mainly credit advances in treatment. Topping the list are refinements in surgery, better diagnostic scanning, and more precise use of radiation. They also celebrate the impact of newer drugs. Genetic testing can now identify specific cancer cell mutations, which allow more targeted therapy using newer pharmaceuticals that are a step beyond traditional chemotherapy. “It’s an exciting time,” said Dr. Jyoti Patel, a Northwestern University lung cancer expert. Even patients with late-stage cancers are surviving for several years — rather than months — after treatment starts, she said. “That was very, very uncommon a decade ago,” she said. New immunotherapy drugs could accelerate the death rate decline, Patel said. Cancer Society researchers also found: — The overall cancer death rate fell by nearly 30% from 1991 through 2017. — Death rates from one type of skin cancer dropped even more dramatically than lung cancer — falling 7% a year recently. That decline in melanoma patients is attributed to drugs that came on the market about nine years ago. — Declines in the death rates from prostate, breast and colon cancer are slowing, for a range of reasons. — The rising liver cancer death rate seems to have leveled off somewhat. That may be related to better treatment of hepatitis C infections, which are tied to about 25% of liver cancer cases, Siegel said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

The long-awaited COVID-19 vaccine has shown promising results in phase 3 trials, bringing hope to millions worldwide who have been anxiously waiting for a breakthrough in the fight against the pandemic. Recent data released by pharmaceutical companies involved in vaccine development indicates high efficacy rates, raising expectations that an end to this global health crisis may be on the horizon.

Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, two major players in the race for a COVID-19 vaccine, recently announced positive progress in their respective trials. Pfizer-BioNTech's mRNA-based vaccine demonstrated an efficacy rate of 95%, while Moderna's candidate showed an impressive efficacy rate of 94.5%. These figures exceed the World Health Organization's threshold for an effective vaccine, which is set at 50%.

In addition to the high efficacy rates, both vaccines were deemed safe with no serious side effects reported during the trials. This is a critical factor in gaining public trust as concerns about the safety of rapid vaccine development have been raised. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stringent protocols in place to ensure that any approved vaccine meets the necessary safety standards.

These recent developments have not only sparked excitement among the general public, but they have also garnered the attention of governments worldwide. Many countries have expressed interest in securing doses of these vaccines as soon as they are approved for distribution. The unprecedented collaboration between governments, scientists, and the pharmaceutical industry has allowed for expedited vaccine development, giving hope to populations devastated by the economic and health impacts of the pandemic.

While the vaccine news is undoubtedly positive, there are still challenges that lie ahead in terms of production, distribution, and public acceptance. Mass production of billions of doses will require collaborations with manufacturers to ramp up capacity. Additionally, developing efficient distribution systems to ensure equitable access across different regions will be crucial. The logistical complexities of a global vaccination campaign cannot be understated.

Moreover, public skepticism and vaccine hesitancy must be addressed to attain the necessary level of community immunity. Effective communication from health authorities is vital to address concerns and provide transparent information about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. This will help build public confidence and encourage widespread acceptance of immunization programs that are essential in curbing the spread of the virus.

Experts caution that despite these promising results, it may take several more months before the general population can access the vaccines. The prioritization of high-risk groups such as healthcare workers and the elderly is likely to delay mass vaccination efforts. In the meantime, adherence to preventive measures, such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and frequent handwashing, remain crucial in slowing down the transmission of the virus.

In conclusion, the recent phase 3 trial results for COVID-19 vaccines have provided a glimmer of hope in the battle against the pandemic. High efficacy rates and safety profiles indicate that an effective solution may soon be within reach. However, challenges surrounding production, distribution, and public acceptance need to be overcome. As the world eagerly anticipates the availability of the vaccine, it is crucial to continue practicing preventive measures to protect ourselves and others until widespread vaccination becomes a reality.",true
4359,Texas officials investigating possible tuberculosis exposure.,"El Paso’s Department of Public Health is investigating the possible TB exposure at Hanks High School. Officials believe a student came in close contact with someone who had an active case of TB. Robert Resendes is the director of the city’s Public Health Department. He says free testing will be available to those who may have been exposed. Health officials say the bacterial illness isn’t easily transmitted and requires extensive exposure to spread. It can be contracted by breathing in infected droplets from the cough or sneeze of a person with active TB. Symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood, fever, night sweats and chronic weakness.","Study Shows COVID-19 Vaccines Effectively Prevent Severe Illness and Hospitalizations

A recent study has highlighted the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe illness and hospitalizations among those who contract the virus. The findings provide further evidence that widespread vaccination plays a crucial role in controlling the ongoing pandemic.

The study, conducted by a team of researchers from renowned health institutions, analyzed data from thousands of confirmed COVID-19 cases across different age groups and regions. The research focused on individuals who had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and compared their outcomes with those who were unvaccinated.

The results revealed a stark difference between the two groups. Among vaccinated individuals who contracted COVID-19, the majority experienced only mild symptoms or remained asymptomatic. In contrast, unvaccinated individuals faced a significantly higher risk of developing severe illness and requiring hospitalization.

Dr. Sarah Johnson, the lead researcher of the study, emphasized the importance of these findings. ""Our research demonstrates that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe disease and hospitalizations,"" said Dr. Johnson. ""This reinforces the need for continued efforts to increase vaccination rates globally.""

The study also analyzed the impact of different vaccines on severe illness prevention. It found that various vaccines currently authorized for emergency use were equally effective in preventing severe disease. This underscores the significance of ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines on a global scale rather than focusing solely on particular brands.

These findings come as a response to growing concerns over breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals. While breakthrough infections do occur, the study affirms that the vaccines' primary goal is not to prevent all infections but rather to minimize the risk of severe illness and hospitalizations among those who do contract COVID-19.

Experts believe that the study's findings will be essential in encouraging vaccine hesitant individuals to reconsider their stance. Vaccine hesitancy has been a significant barrier to achieving herd immunity in many countries. However, with evidence showcasing the vaccines' effectiveness in preventing severe outcomes, it is expected that more individuals will be motivated to get vaccinated.

Dr. Emily Thompson, an infectious disease specialist, stated, ""By getting vaccinated, not only do you protect yourself from severe illness and hospitalization, but you also contribute to safeguarding your community and limiting the virus's spread. It's a win-win situation.""

As new variants of the virus continue to emerge, monitoring vaccine effectiveness remains crucial. While current vaccines have shown promising results against most variants, ongoing research and vaccine adaptations may be necessary to sustain protection as the virus evolves.

The study concludes with yet another reminder of the continued importance of adhering to public health measures alongside vaccination. Mask-wearing, social distancing, and regular hand hygiene remain significant tools in curbing the spread of COVID-19, particularly amid emerging variants and increasing case numbers.

Overall, this study provides further evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness and hospitalizations. As vaccination rates increase globally, there is hope for a brighter future with reduced hospitalizations and fewer lives lost due to the virus.",true
5672,Ebola outbreak spreads to 3rd province in eastern Congo.,"The movement of the potentially deadly disease to a new province highlights the difficulties that health workers in Congo face in controlling the outbreak. Two new patients tested positive in the Mwenga area of South Kivu, adding to North Kivu and Ituri provinces where there are confirmed cases of the disease, according to the health ministry. The new cases are “a 24-year-old woman and her 7-month-old child,” said Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, the director of Congo’s National Institute for Biomedical Research, in a statement released on Friday. The mother and her child had visited Beni, in North Kivu province, which is the center of the outbreak. They returned to South Kivu province where they fell sick with Ebola. The mother died Thursday and her child is being treated by a response team, said Muyembe’s statement. The local Ebola response team has identified more than 120 people who may have been infected with the Ebola virus by contact with the woman and her child. Those people will be vaccinated to reduce the risk that they will get Ebola. The Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo has killed 1,808 people out of 2,765 confirmed cases, according to the new report. The current outbreak, which started on Aug. 1 last year, is the second largest in history. The spread of confirmed cases to a third province shows that health workers have struggled to contain the outbreak, despite the use of a vaccine. Many people in eastern Congo do not trust doctors and other medics. An average of 81 new cases of Ebola are confirmed each week, according to the World Health Organization, which issued an update on the outbreak Friday. WHO said that its appeal for $287 million to fund the public health part of its campaign to control this outbreak has only received $15 million so far. Earlier this week, doctors announced positive news that two new drugs appear to be effective at saving lives of those who fall ill with Ebola. Muyembe and other scientists announced that preliminary results from a trial in Congo found two drugs — made by Regeneron and the U.S. National Institutes of Health — seem to be saving lives. Researchers said more study is needed to nail down how well those two compounds work. The drugs are antibodies that block Ebola. In the trial, significantly fewer people died among those given the Regeneron drug or the NIH’s, about 30%, compared to those who received another treatment. There is less danger that Ebola will spread through Goma, the capital of North Kivu province with more than 2 million inhabitants, because about 200 contacts and suspected cases have been identified and have received proper medication, said Muyembe. He said people arriving in Goma are being monitored at the city’s entry points. Health officials have also vaccinated tens of thousands of people in Congo and surrounding countries in an attempt to stop the outbreak, but the virus has now continued to spread for more than a year. Response efforts have been repeatedly hampered by attacks on health workers and continuing mistrust among the affected communities; many people in the region don’t believe the virus is real and choose to stay at home when they fall ill, infecting those who care for them. ___ Maliro contributed to this report from Beni, Congo. ___ Follow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa","A new study suggests that millions of children worldwide have missed out on regular vaccinations due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This alarming situation poses a serious threat to public health as it increases the risk of outbreaks of preventable diseases such as measles, polio, and diphtheria.

According to research conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, an estimated 23 million children missed out on basic vaccines through routine immunization services in 2020. This significant drop in vaccination coverage is mainly attributed to the suspension of essential healthcare services and travel restrictions implemented in response to the pandemic.

The study highlights that this interruption in vaccination programs is not limited to certain regions but has occurred across the globe. It is particularly worrisome in lower-income countries where healthcare systems were already stretched thin before the pandemic hit. The lack of access to vaccines and healthcare facilities further exacerbates the issue, leaving vulnerable children at a higher risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases.

The consequences of interrupted routine immunizations are already becoming apparent. For instance, Afghanistan has reported an alarming increase in cases of vaccine-preventable diseases like polio since the start of the pandemic. Similarly, several African countries have experienced outbreaks of measles, causing suffering and death among young children who could have been protected if vaccination campaigns had not been disrupted.

Furthermore, the lack of regular immunizations can have long-term effects beyond immediate outbreaks. When vaccination coverage drops, it compromises the concept of herd immunity, which depends on a large majority of the population being vaccinated to protect those who cannot receive vaccines due to medical reasons. With reduced immunity levels, diseases that were once under control can quickly spread and cause significant morbidity and mortality.

To address this emerging crisis, global organizations like WHO and UNICEF are working closely with governments, health ministries, and other stakeholders to restore immunization services. Restoration efforts include adapting service delivery to the current circumstances, implementing catch-up vaccination programs, and ensuring vaccine supply chains remain intact.

Efforts are also underway to improve access to vaccines for vulnerable communities through mobile clinics and outreach programs. Additionally, governments are urged to prioritize routine immunization services within their broader COVID-19 response strategies.

The situation serves as a wake-up call for the urgent need to invest in resilient healthcare systems that can withstand and respond effectively to such emergencies. It is essential to develop contingency plans that ensure uninterrupted delivery of critical health services during crises while maintaining infection prevention measures.

Furthermore, misinformation about vaccines must be robustly addressed through targeted communication campaigns to rebuild trust and confidence in immunizations. Vaccinations have been one of the most effective public health interventions in history, saving countless lives and eradicating diseases. This crisis should not undermine the trust established over decades but rather strengthen efforts to reach every child with life-saving vaccines.

As countries continue to grapple with the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic, it is crucial to remember the vital role that routine vaccinations play in protecting our children from deadly diseases. Restoring and maintaining routine immunization services must become a global priority to prevent avoidable outbreaks and ensure the health and well-being of future generations.",true
8185,Vanuatu to impose coronavirus travel restrictions ahead of election.,"The new restriction would include a ban on travel from regional heavyweight Australia, which has nearly 500 coronavirus cases, an official from Vanuatu’s National Novel Coronavirus Taskforce told Reuters. Vanuatu, population 300,000, will hold a general election on March 19, with the electoral commission encouraging voters to stand two-meters apart and use hand sanitizer at polling booths. “Many people are looking forward to the election and I don’t think COVID-19 will be an issue,” said Russel Tamata, communications officer for the Vanuatu taskforce. An advisory expected to be released on Wednesday will warn Vanuatu citizens not to travel to, or transit through, a list of countries with 100 COVID-19 cases or more, said Tamata. International flights wouldn’t be stopped, but arriving passengers would need to show a medical clearance proving they had undergone 14 days of quarantine before arriving in Vanuatu. Multiple South Pacific island nations have restricted flights and banned cruise ships from ports for 60 days, hitting crucial tourism revenues in the region, after six COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the Pacific islands. “This is going to be devastating for Pacific economies. Whether it’s aid, trade, migration or tourism, all those countries depend on major countries like Australia and China for their supply chains,” said Jonathan Pryke, director of the Australia-based Lowy Institute’s Pacific Islands program. “They are using their relative isolation as a remote island as a strength to put the wall up. It makes sense given the fragility of their health systems.”  The Pacific region has recorded three coronavirus cases in French Polynesia and three in Guam - although most island nations cannot screen for the virus onshore which is potentially masking its spread. The Post Courier newspaper in Papua New Guinea said the health minister had confirmed a man with a history of travel to Europe was being tested for COVID-19 after developing a fever. Vanuatu is sending COVID-19 test samples to overseas laboratories and receiving results seven days later. The island country expects to conduct the first tests onshore in a “few weeks”, said Posikai Samuel Tapo, director for Vanuatu’s health security services.","New Study Finds COVID-19 Vaccines Highly Effective in Preventing Hospitalization and Death

A new study has shed light on the incredible efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death. The findings provide further evidence of the crucial role vaccination plays in combatting the ongoing pandemic.

The research, conducted by a team of scientists from several renowned institutions, analyzed data from over two million individuals who had contracted COVID-19 between January and June of this year. Their aim was to determine the real-world effectiveness of the vaccines in protecting against serious outcomes.

The results were unequivocal. Among the study participants who received the full dosage of an authorized COVID-19 vaccine, there was a staggering 94% reduction in the risk of hospitalization compared to those who were unvaccinated. Additionally, the chances of requiring intensive care or ventilation were reduced by an impressive 96%.

Perhaps most significantly, the researchers discovered that the vaccines offered remarkable protection against death caused by COVID-19. The fully vaccinated individuals were found to have a 92% lower risk of dying from the virus compared to those who hadn't been vaccinated. This finding underscores the life-saving potential of widespread immunization efforts.

The study also examined the efficacy of different vaccines. While all authorized vaccines were found to be highly effective, there were slight variations in their performance. The mRNA-based vaccines showed the highest level of protection against hospitalization, ICU admission, ventilation, and death.

Furthermore, the researchers investigated breakthrough infections ?C instances where fully vaccinated individuals still tested positive for COVID-19. They determined that while these breakthrough cases could occur, they were relatively rare. Only a small proportion of fully vaccinated individuals experienced infection, and even then, the disease was generally milder and less severe compared to infections among unvaccinated individuals.

These findings provide essential reassurance regarding the vaccines' overall effectiveness. They highlight the importance of universal vaccination to reduce the burden on healthcare systems and save lives. The study demonstrates that even in areas with high vaccination rates, breakthrough infections are not a cause for alarm as they are generally mild and rarely result in severe illness or death.

Public health officials have consistently urged individuals to get vaccinated to protect themselves and their communities. These new findings further emphasize the vital role of vaccination in breaking the chain of transmission and preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes.

As the Delta variant continues to spread rapidly worldwide, the urgency to vaccinate has never been more critical. This highly transmissible variant poses a significant threat, particularly to those who remain unvaccinated. By getting vaccinated, individuals can significantly reduce their risk of severe illness, protect vulnerable populations, and contribute to the global effort to overcome the pandemic.

It is important to note that while the vaccines provide substantial protection, they are not foolproof. It remains crucial to continue practicing other preventive measures, such as wearing masks in indoor public spaces, maintaining physical distance, and following local health guidelines.

In conclusion, this latest study reinforces the high efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing hospitalization and death. Vaccination stands as a powerful tool in our fight against the ongoing pandemic. By getting vaccinated, individuals can safeguard their health and contribute to the collective goal of bringing an end to this global crisis.",true
4510,Bill targets vaccine misinformation amid measles outbreak.,"The Kansas City Star reports Roberts introduced legislation Thursday to instruct Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to award competitive grants for public information campaigns aimed at combating the anti-vaccine movement. The bill does not specify a dollar figure, but would enable the CDC to steer money toward them. The Kansas senator called a lack of confidence in vaccines as one of the top public health threats in a video released by his office Thursday. Co-sponsors on the legislation are Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan and Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, both Democrats. ___ Information from: The Kansas City Star, http://www.kcstar.com","Health experts warn of the increasing threat of COVID-19 as the highly contagious Delta variant spreads rapidly across communities. With its ability to evade vaccine protection and cause severe illness, the Delta variant has led to a resurgence of cases worldwide.

The Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, was first identified in India in late 2020. Since then, it has quickly become the dominant strain in many countries, leading to significant spikes in infection rates. This variant is characterized by its increased transmissibility, making it far more contagious than the original strain.

Studies have shown that the Delta variant is particularly adept at evading the immune response produced by vaccines. Although vaccination remains crucial in preventing severe illness and hospitalization, breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated individuals have been reported. However, it is essential to note that vaccinated individuals still have a significantly lower risk of severe disease compared to unvaccinated ones.

The rise of the Delta variant has pushed public health officials to reevaluate their strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Many countries have reinstated preventive measures such as mask mandates, social distancing, and capacity restrictions. Moreover, governments are pushing harder to promote vaccination campaigns and encourage hesitant individuals to get vaccinated.

In areas with low vaccination rates, the Delta variant poses an even greater threat. Health experts warn that these regions are potential breeding grounds for new variants to emerge. As the virus continues to circulate among unvaccinated populations, there is an increased likelihood of mutations occurring, potentially yielding more dangerous strains in the future.

One of the biggest concerns surrounding the Delta variant is its impact on children. While previous strains of the virus predominantly affected older adults, the Delta variant has demonstrated a higher affinity for infecting younger age groups. As vaccination rates remain low in children, they are more vulnerable to serious illness, posing a significant challenge to schools and families as they prepare for the upcoming academic year.

To mitigate the Delta variant's impact, health authorities stress the importance of a multi-pronged approach. Vaccinations play a central role in preventing severe disease and hospitalization. Furthermore, promoting mask-wearing, maintaining good hand hygiene, and practicing social distancing are crucial in limiting transmission.

Efforts to address vaccine equity are also critical. Many low-income countries are facing significant challenges in accessing vaccines, leaving their populations at a higher risk of infection from the Delta variant. Global collaboration and support are necessary to ensure equitable vaccine distribution and prevent further transmission on a global scale.

As we navigate the ongoing pandemic, it is vital for individuals to stay informed and follow the guidance of public health officials. With the Delta variant surging, a collective effort is needed to protect ourselves and our communities. By getting vaccinated and adhering to preventive measures, we can reduce the impact of this rapidly spreading variant and move closer to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.",true
1593,"U.S. women push back against stigma, cost of menstruation.","The South Orange, New Jersey, residents got the idea for their charity, Girls Helping Girls Period, when Emma learned that federal assistance programs for the indigent do not cover menstruation products, leaving many low-income and homeless women to cope with their cycles on their own. “We found out a lot of people don’t know that,” Emma said. “That’s the point: to educate the public and to eliminate this issue of being afraid to talk about it. It shouldn’t be a thing we hide.”   The project, Girlshelpinggirlsperiod.org, is part of a growing national movement to address the inequities that have sprung up as a result of the stigma that still surrounds menstruation. Some prisons, for example, force female inmates to buy pads at the commissary, and public restrooms rarely provide them free of charge for emergencies. New York and 39 other states impose sales taxes on tampons and sanitary napkins, while exempting the Rogaine hair regrowth treatment, condoms and other products mostly used by men. Advocates have sued in New York, citing a double standard. Women’s advocates say budgets for homeless shelters, schools, prisons and public restrooms should provide free tampons and sanitary napkins, just as they do for soap, toilet paper and other essentials. In a country where erectile dysfunction ads fill television commercial slots and jokes about flatulence and bowel movements have inspired entire books, the bodily function of menstruation endures as a taboo subject. “It goes all the way back to Eve, to religion, misogyny, all the societal norms we’ve been brought up with,” said Maplewood, New Jersey, lawyer Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, who advocates for equitable menstrual policy in the United States. The shame and embarrassment that many women still feel is reflected in the proliferation of euphemisms for menstruation around the world. “Shark week,” “the curse,” “a visit from Aunt Flo” and “having the painters in” are a few of the 5,000 names documented in a 2015 survey of 90,000 people in 190 countries that was carried out by German healthcare company Clue. “We are trained not to talk about it,” Weiss-Wolf said. “When we don’t talk about it, we don’t consider it. We don’t think, ‘Hey, for poor people, this is actually expensive; this can be a problem.’”   Experts say the average woman spends $70 a year on tampons and pads, not to mention the cost of replacing underwear and clothing when accidents inevitably happen. Eighty-six percent of U.S. women aged 18 to 54 say they have experienced the unexpected onset of their period in public without the supplies they needed, according to a 2013 survey conducted on behalf of FreeTheTampons.org, an Ohio-based initiative to provide free tampons in restrooms. “Menstrual products are not luxury items,” said U.S. Representative Grace Meng of Queens, New York. Because of her efforts, the Federal Emergency Management Agency updated its rules to allow homeless people to pay for tampons with funds once restricted to such items as diapers and toothpaste. “We’ve heard stories of young girls using rags, where girls are not able to go to school on days that they get their period,” said Meng. “If you’re missing an average of five days of school each month, this affects more than just menstruation time.”  The problem extends far beyond the United States, with 17 percent of women around the world saying they had missed school, work or an event because they were afraid someone might find out they had their period, the Clue survey found. At the same time, American girls are menstruating at an increasingly earlier age due to improved nutrition. The average girl starts having her period at age 12 and bleeds for up to seven days a month until she is about 50 years old, according to the womenshealth.gov website. A more matter-of-fact attitude toward menstruation appears to be gaining traction, as evidenced by straightforward advertisements on New York City subways touting Thinx “period-proof” underwear as absorbing “2 tampons’ worth of blood.”  In another sign of change, a free tampon dispenser is being installed in a Queens high school as part of a pilot program aimed at putting the machines throughout the New York City public-school system, the nation’s largest, with more than 1 million students. “It used to be a nasty subject in health class,” said 12-year-old Quinn Joy. “But the moment I found out people were missing school and work, I got over it. Now it’s just woman toilet paper.”","New Covid-19 Variants Threaten Global Vaccination Efforts

The emergence of new and more transmissible variants of the coronavirus is raising concerns among public health officials and experts worldwide. These variants, which have been detected in several countries, pose a major threat to global vaccination efforts and could potentially prolong the fight against the pandemic.

One such variant, known as B.1.1.7 or the UK variant, was first identified in the United Kingdom in late 2020. It has since spread rapidly to numerous countries, including the United States. This variant is said to be up to 70% more contagious than previous strains, leading to a surge in cases and overwhelming healthcare systems. The UK variant has prompted governments to enforce stricter lockdown measures and travel restrictions in an attempt to control its spread.

Another worrisome variant is the B.1.351 strain, first discovered in South Africa. Similar to the UK variant, it is believed to be more transmissible and potentially resistant to certain antibody treatments. This raises concerns about the efficacy of existing vaccines against this variant. Although more research is needed, preliminary data suggests that current vaccines may provide reduced protection against these new strains.

The impact of these variants is significant. As countries around the world are rolling out their vaccination campaigns, the emergence of strains that may be able to evade vaccine-induced immunity presents a serious obstacle. Vaccine manufacturers are working to understand the effectiveness of their products against these variants and developing strategies to enhance vaccine protection.

To address this concern, some pharmaceutical companies have already started modifying their vaccines to target the newer strains. Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, for example, have initiated clinical trials to assess the safety and immunogenicity of booster shots tailored specifically for the variants. Experts believe that updated booster shots targeting the new strains could help ensure long-term efficacy and protect against emerging variants.

In addition to developing updated vaccines, health authorities stress the importance of adhering to public health measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and hand hygiene. These measures remain crucial in limiting the spread of the virus and reducing the opportunity for variants to emerge and proliferate.

Public health officials are also closely monitoring the situation and enhancing genomic surveillance to detect and track new variants. Detecting variants early is critical for implementing targeted public health interventions and adjusting vaccination strategies accordingly.

Despite the challenges posed by the new variants, experts emphasize the importance of maintaining confidence in vaccination efforts. While there may be concerns about reduced effectiveness against specific strains, current vaccines still offer significant protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Getting vaccinated remains a vital tool in combating the pandemic and preventing its devastating consequences.

In conclusion, the emergence of new Covid-19 variants raises serious concerns about the efficacy of existing vaccines and their potential impact on global vaccination efforts. The ability of these variants to transmit more easily, potentially resist antibodies, and affect vaccine effectiveness underscores the need for prompt action. Vaccine manufacturers and health authorities must work collaboratively to develop updated vaccines, enhance surveillance, and adapt vaccination strategies to stay ahead of the evolving virus. In the meantime, individuals must continue to observe preventive measures and get vaccinated when eligible to protect themselves and others from the potentially severe impacts of the disease.",true

The letter to Juul asked if the company has conducted or financed studies on the health implications of using its products and the effectiveness of Juul in helping users quit smoking. It asked if Juul has sent information to the Food and Drug Administration. Kaelan Hollon, a spokeswoman for Reynolds American, said the company is reviewing the letter and believes “minors should never use tobacco products, including vapor products.”   Japan Tobacco said in a statement it welcomes any opportunity to “set out the responsible approaches” it takes in its marketing. Juul and Fontem Ventures did not respond to requests for comment. The probe comes amid growing scrutiny of the e-cigarette industry by lawmakers. A separate House panel in July released internal Juul emails that committee staff described as attempts to “enter schools and convey its messaging directly to teenage children.”   James Monsees, Juul’s co-founder and chief product officer, told the panel the company’s target audience is adult cigarette smokers. Representative Frank Pallone, the Democratic chair of the committee, cited vaping-related lung illnesses recently reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He requested answers and documents by Sept. 20. The CDC said on Wednesday it is investigating 153 possible cases of severe lung illness associated with e-cigarette use in 16 states. No deaths have been reported, they said.","COVID-19 Variants Pose New Challenges to Global Health 

The ongoing battle against the coronavirus pandemic has taken an unpredictable turn as new and more transmissible variants of COVID-19 emerge. These variants, such as the Delta variant, are spreading rapidly across the globe and threatening to undermine recent progress made in containing the virus.

The Delta variant, first identified in India, is now causing concern in various countries due to its high transmission rates. Experts warn that this variant is significantly more contagious than previous strains and is fueling a fresh wave of infections. In countries like the United Kingdom and Australia, where the Delta variant has been dominant, cases have surged, forcing authorities to reimpose restrictions and ramp up vaccination efforts.

Health officials worldwide are closely monitoring other variants as well, including the Gamma variant from Brazil and the Beta variant from South Africa. These mutations are also proving to be highly transmissible and may be evading some level of immunity provided by previous infections or vaccines.

Furthermore, recent reports suggest the emergence of a new variant known as Lambda, first discovered in Peru. While it is still not clear if this variant poses an additional risk compared to others, its potential for rapid spread is worrisome. The Lambda variant has already been detected in several countries, reminding us that the fight against COVID-19 is far from over.

The rise of these variants raises concerns not only about increased transmission but also about possible vaccine efficacy. Several studies have shown that existing vaccines still offer significant protection against severe illness and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that fully vaccinated individuals can still contract and transmit the virus, albeit at lower rates compared to the unvaccinated population.

To address these challenges, health authorities are urging individuals to continue practicing preventive measures such as wearing masks, maintaining physical distance, and practicing good hand hygiene. Vaccination campaigns are being accelerated, with countries aiming to fully vaccinate as many people as possible to curtail the spread of these variants.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and vaccine manufacturers are also exploring booster shots to enhance protection against emerging variants. These potential booster doses could help bolster immune responses in vaccinated individuals and provide added defense against new strains of the virus.

Additionally, researchers are striving to stay one step ahead by studying and analyzing the genetic makeup of these variants to develop targeted therapies or updated vaccines. Scientists believe that continuous genomic surveillance of the virus and global collaboration is crucial to mitigate the impact of variants and prevent future outbreaks.

As we navigate this ever-evolving landscape, it is vital for governments, health organizations, and individuals to remain vigilant. The battle against COVID-19 is now a race against time and mutating variants. It is only through collective efforts, ongoing research, and effective public health measures that we can hope to overcome these challenges and restore normalcy to our lives.

In conclusion, the emergence of highly transmissible COVID-19 variants, including the Delta, Gamma, Beta, and Lambda variants, poses significant challenges to global health. These mutations have led to surges in cases, necessitating renewed restrictions and intensified vaccination campaigns. While existing vaccines still provide protection against severe illness, breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals highlight the need for continued preventive measures and potential booster shots. Vigilance, international cooperation, and ongoing research are key to containing the spread of these variants and ultimately triumphing over the pandemic.",true

Codey, who was governor from November 2004 to January 2006, signed an executive order in November 2004 to create the Governor’s Task Force on Mental Health to investigate the state’s mental health system. One of the task force’s recommendations was creation of the council, with an aim to educate people about mental illness. """"The thing about mental health is it knows no barriers, rich or poor, black or white,"""" Codey told us. Codey raised more than one issue in his statement, so we’ll look at the number of people in New Jersey affected by mental illness, explain the budget cut and identify """"serious mental illness."""" First, New Jersey had 3,152,877 households from 2005 to 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If each household is considered a family, that means approximately 630,575 New Jerseyans had a mental illness during that time, based on Codey’s statistic. Second, state Treasury Department spokesman Bill Quinn confirmed the $50,000 cut and said the money was used for promotional materials and expenses related to council Executive Director Celina Gray’s outreach efforts about mental illness. Quinn said Gray remains employed and the council still exists, but the work connected with it has been folded into the Human Services Department’s Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services. The governor’s office did not respond to two email requests for comment on Codey’s statement. Codey, Carolla and Phil Lubitz, associate director of NAMI’s state office in North Brunswick, each identified serious mental illness as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depression and panic disorder. """"Loved ones also applies to immediate family members,"""" Lubitz said. Although Codey’s statement was about New Jersey, the 1-in-5 statistic is used by these organizations: the U.S. Surgeon General’s Office; the American Psychiatric Association; and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. """"In 2009, there were an estimated 45.1 million people with any mental illness in the past year -- that’s 19.9 percent of all individuals age 12 and older … or, if you prefer, about 1 in every 5 individuals,"""" Bradford Stone, spokesman for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, said in an email. """"For serious mental illness, the rate was 4.8 percent (about 1 in every 20 individuals) or 11.0 million individuals for all individuals age 18 and older."""" NAMI has used 1 in 4 families since 2007, and the National Institute of Mental Health cites both statistics. """"The current prevalence estimate is that about 20 percent of the U.S. population are affected by mental disorders during a given year,"""" according to """"Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General,"""" issued in 1999 and still one of the main standards today in assessing mental illness, Carolla said. Let’s review. In responding to a budget cut for a council formed by the Governor’s Task Force on Mental Health, Codey said that one in every five New Jersey families has a loved one with a mental illness. Various reports from at least three organizations cite that statistic, but NAMI cites 1-in-4. Another national organization cites both. Even with the slight disparity, the overall point of Codey’s statement is that mental illness is very common.

A new study published today reveals promising results regarding the effectiveness of the coronavirus vaccine in children. The study, conducted by a team of researchers from multiple institutions across the country, provides an essential step toward protecting younger individuals against COVID-19.

The research involved over 5,000 children ages 12 to 17 and assessed the efficacy of the vaccine specifically in this age group. Preliminary findings show that the vaccine was highly effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 cases among the participants. Out of the vaccinated group, only a small percentage experienced mild symptoms, while the majority remained completely asymptomatic.

Dr. Sarah Collins, the lead researcher on the study, stated that these results are extremely encouraging for parents and educators who have been concerned about the virus's impact on children. She highlighted that vaccinating adolescents is crucial for reducing transmission rates within schools and communities, ultimately leading to a safer environment for all.

In addition to being highly effective, the vaccine was also well-tolerated by the young participants. Most reported mild or moderate side effects such as soreness at the injection site, fatigue, or headache, following similar patterns observed in adults. Severe adverse reactions were rare, demonstrating that the benefits of the vaccine greatly outweigh any potential risks.

Vaccinating this age group has become a priority as evidence suggests that teenagers can play a significant role in spreading the virus. With many schools preparing for in-person learning this fall, ensuring the safety of students and staff is paramount. The study findings offer reassurance that vaccination can significantly contribute to achieving this goal.

The positive outcomes of this research further support the growing consensus among public health experts and regulatory authorities that expanding vaccination efforts to include children is the right course of action. The FDA and CDC will thoroughly review the study data to determine whether emergency use authorization should be extended to the adolescent population.

Once authorized, it is expected that vaccine distribution for children aged 12 and above will commence promptly. Vaccination sites, including pediatric clinics, pharmacies, and school-based programs, are anticipated to play a crucial role in the administration of the shots.

Parents expressed relief upon learning about the study's findings. Anna Thompson, a mother of two teenagers, said she had been concerned about her children's vulnerability to the virus, especially as new variants emerge. ""Knowing that the vaccine is effective in this age group brings me peace of mind,"" she remarked.

Experts caution, however, that achieving herd immunity requires vaccinating a significant portion of the population, including younger age groups. Continued efforts to inform and encourage parents to have their children vaccinated are critical in curbing transmission and preventing future outbreaks.

As the scientific community continues its exploration into COVID-19, studies like this offer invaluable insights into protecting the most vulnerable segments of our population. The publication of these results marks a significant step forward in combatting the current public health crisis by extending vaccination protection to adolescents, ultimately bringing us one step closer to controlling the spread of the virus and returning to normalcy.",true
8165,"Coronavirus spreads fear, isolation, death to elderly worldwide.","Dowell decided last week that strict isolation was the only way to protect herself, her husband and her mother from COVID-19, the virus that has killed more than 10,000 people across the globe and is proving especially deadly for the elderly. Dowell, a retired labor union worker, has rheumatoid arthritis and a compromised immune system. Her husband Donald, 74, suffers from emphysema. Her mother, Margaret Hildebrandt, 93, also has a lung disease and needs oxygen. Dowell took over her mother’s care from a visiting nurse because she worried an outsider could contaminate the home. “If my mom gets this, she’d be gone in a day,” said Dowell, who wears a baby-monitor and answers her mother’s calls for help through the night. “My mom beat cancer nine times. I don’t want her to die from this.”  The elderly are especially vulnerable in the global pandemic and health officials and governments are increasingly calling for extreme measures to safeguard them. Across the globe, many cities have all but shut down as officials issue dire warnings for younger people - who can carry the virus without knowing it - to avoid their parents and grandparents. But this growing isolation of the elderly has spawned its own crisis, as families try to balance the need to care for loved ones with directives to stay away, shifting the burden to overstretched governments and medical facilities. Studies suggest the severity of coronavirus rises with age. In Italy, which now has the world’s highest death count, the average age of those dying is 80, according to a study by the Italian national institute of health. In China, where the pandemic started, people 70 and older accounted for just 12 percent of all infections but more than half of all deaths, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States, people 65 and older  have thus far accounted for 31 percent of cases, 53 percent of intensive care hospitalizations and 80 percent of deaths, according to U.S. government data. Beyond the grim statistics, the pandemic has spawned countless small dramas of isolation and anxiety across the globe. In a village in Lebanon, a grandmother walled herself off in her home, unable to properly grieve her dead husband. In Spain, nursery home workers produced a Facebook video so residents could reassure their loved ones. And in Colombia - where the government on Tuesday ordered citizens 70 and over to stay inside until May 31 - seniors stocked up on supplies for two months of isolation. “They need to take these measures because many people are taking the situation lightly,” said shopper Carlos Manrique, 74, as he loaded up on potatoes, eggs and rice at a supermarket in Bogota. “I’m taking care of myself, as God orders.”  Just as often, older people greeted the epidemic with defiance. “I am not worried about the coronavirus at all,” said Yutaka Kobayashi, 85, who refuses to wear a mask while working in his Tokyo shoe store. “People of my generation were made to wash their hands by their mothers and grandmothers.”  In Italy, where more than 3,400 people have died since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, local officials fret about the psychological state of elderly people confined to their homes for weeks in a government lockdown. The town of San Casciano in Val di Pesa launched an initiative called “Ciao Nonna, come stai?” or “Hello Gran, how are you?” urging all young people to call elderly relatives – or even older people they don’t know. One nursing home, Nuestra Casa La Grande in Navares de Enmedio, Spain, recorded a video of 24 elderly residents and posted it on Facebook, encouraging each other to blow kisses to the camera for their loved ones. Jonathan Barrios, a 24-year-old student living with his parents in La Parla, Madrid, said he doesn’t dare see his grandparents, who live on the same street. His 80-year-old grandfather has lung cancer. His grandmother, 70, has symptoms of the virus - a fever, cough and difficulty breathing - but can’t get tested because of a shortage of kits. “I feel strange and frustrated,” Barrios said. “All I can do for my grandparents is to call them.”  The forced isolation perhaps cuts deepest for those in mourning. Joey Ayoub, a Lebanese researcher, said his grandfather died this week of problems unrelated to the coronavirus. He worries for his grandmother, who suddenly lives alone. Only six or seven people attended her husband’s funeral, which Ayoub said would otherwise have attracted “dozens and dozens.” They all sat at a distance from one another during a rushed service. “She can’t mourn properly,” he said. “She cannot do it with friends.”  Some families have been hit hard when senior care centers closed, forcing them to take off work to watch over relatives. In the central Japan city of Nagoya, the mayor asked 126 such facilities to shut down for two weeks after a cluster of coronavirus cases was found at one of them. Japan has already weathered serious outbreaks of the virus and has huge numbers of people at risk - more than 28 percent of the nation’s population is 65 or over. But now, some people are venturing out again. “If I get it, I get it,” said Kazuko Mori, 74, a part-time cleaner in suburban Ichikawa, which had clusters of cases originating at a sports gym and an elderly daycare service. “If you get too nervous about it all, that isn’t good, either.”  Many elderly people said they can’t follow government directives to stay home. In Kibera, a settlement of densely packed neighborhoods where few homes have running water in Kenya’s capital Nairobi, volunteers knocked on doors to tell people – especially the elderly – about the coronavirus. In one courtyard filled with children, Fatima Juma listened intently as Zulela Abdul explained the risks to her and handed over a small bottle of hand sanitizer. Juma, who says she’s about 82, had heard of the disease on television but didn’t know its symptoms. She was fine with washing her hands but rejected the idea of social distancing. She takes care of her grandchildren, the youngest one two years old, while their parents worked. She also needed to see her friends, she said. “This government directive is not good for me. I need to go to the market,” she said firmly, bangles flashing in the sunlight. “If there is a death outside, I need to go and console that person.”  In Communist-run Cuba, which has Latin America’s oldest population, many people are forced to work long after retirement age to supplement meager pensions. Even in normal times, they endure long lines at stores and pharmacies. “I am very worried because I have asthma, and if I get it, I will die,” said Maria Torres Hernandez, 75, waiting alongside dozens of others outside a pharmacy in central Havana that had just received its ration of supplies. “I have to look after myself.”  Angel Pupo Osorio, 80, works as a parking attendant in Havana to supplement his $12-a-month pension, and can’t afford to quit. So far, the disease hasn’t hit his neighborhood. “I’m going to continue working as long as I can, out of necessity,” said Pupo, wearing his uniform, a scarlet jacket and cap. Lucy Mayimela, a 68-year-old grandmother, first heard about the coronavirus on Monday when she made a trip to buy spinach for her fruit and vegetable stand in Kliptown, on the outskirts of Johannesburg. The farmer selling it to her wore a mask and insisted everyone repeatedly wash their hands before touching anything. Mayimela laughed bitterly at a suggestion she heard on the radio that she should isolate herself at home. “Isolate myself how?” she scoffed. She lives in a small shack with six relatives, in a community with a single wash basin and toilet for dozens of people. The produce stand she has run for 36 years provides her family’s only income. “I’ll end up dying of hunger” if people stay indoors, she said. “If God wants me to die, then it’s my time.”","More People Seek Mental Health Support Amidst Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the mental health of individuals worldwide. As the outbreak rages on, an increasing number of people are seeking mental health support to cope with the relentless challenges brought about by the virus and associated restrictions.

The global health crisis has taken a toll on various aspects of society, including physical health, economic stability, and social interactions. However, the psychological impact cannot be overlooked. With prolonged periods of isolation, fear, and uncertainty, many individuals are struggling with their mental well-being.

According to a recent survey conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), there has been a substantial rise in mental health concerns since the outset of the pandemic. The survey revealed that 70% of participating countries have witnessed disruptions to mental health services for vulnerable populations, including children and adolescents, older adults, and frontline workers. Additionally, 67% reported interruptions in counseling and psychotherapy services, while 61% experienced disruptions in critical psychosocial support programs.

The reasons for seeking mental health support during these challenging times are manifold. Social isolation, often resulting from lockdown measures, has adversely affected mental well-being. Many individuals, particularly those living alone, have felt isolated, leading to feelings of loneliness, sadness, and anxiety. The overall uncertainty surrounding the virus and its consequences has also contributed to increased stress levels and emotional distress.

Financial strain caused by job loss or reduced income has intensified existing mental health conditions and triggered new ones. Economic instability amplifies anxiety and depression among individuals who worry about meeting basic needs, paying bills, and providing for their families.

Frontline healthcare workers, who have faced immense pressure and long working hours, are particularly susceptible to mental health challenges. The continuous exposure to life-threatening situations and witnessing the suffering of patients takes a heavy toll on their psychological well-being. Many have reported experiencing symptoms of burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression.

In response to the growing demand for mental health support, governments and healthcare systems are striving to bolster existing services and implement new initiatives. Online and telehealth services have emerged as crucial tools for delivering care remotely, ensuring individuals can access help without compromising their safety. Many organizations and charities have also launched helplines and virtual support groups to reach those in need.

However, despite these efforts, significant barriers to mental health services persist. In many countries, there is a shortage of mental health professionals, resulting in long waiting times and limited access to care. Furthermore, stigma surrounding mental health issues remains prevalent, deterring individuals from seeking help due to fear of discrimination or judgment.

It is essential to prioritize mental health and provide the necessary resources and support to those in need. Governments and health authorities must invest in mental health services, including training more professionals, increasing public awareness, and eliminating stigmatization. Employers should also prioritize the well-being of their employees by fostering supportive work environments and offering resources for mental health.

As the world continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing the mental health crisis must be at the forefront of our efforts. By recognizing the importance of mental well-being and providing accessible and comprehensive support, we can collectively navigate these challenging times and emerge stronger, fostering resilience and healing within our communities.",true
6122,"Trump cites his support for Medicare, slams Medicare for All.","Trump skipped past his own proposals for Medicare budget cuts, and he ignored the fact that no Democrat is proposing to take coverage or benefits away from seniors. During a visit to The Villages, a bustling community for adults in Central Florida, Trump was trying to turn attention away from House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry and focus on pocket-book issues instead. “That’s why they do the impeachment crap, because they know they can’t beat us fairly,” he told the friendly audience, which included many seniors. That part of Florida voted overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016. Health care has emerged as a central issue for Democrats competing for their party’s 2020 presidential nomination. Much of the debate has centered on Sen. Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare for All” plan, which would cover everyone under a government-run plan and eliminate most private insurance. Trump said electing a Democrat would jeopardize seniors’ access to health care. “Medicare is under threat like never before,” Trump said. “Almost every major Democrat in Washington has backed a massive government health care takeover that would totally obliterate Medicare.” Far from “obliterating’’ Medicare, Sanders says his plan would lower costs and provide new benefits, including coverage for long-term care. Medicare, which covers about 60 million seniors and disabled people, is the government’s flagship health care program. Trump also signed an executive order directing his administration to pursue changes to Medicare. Much of what he wants to do is geared toward enhancing Medicare Advantage, the private insurance option picked by about one-third of seniors. Medicare Advantage plans offer savings on premiums and an annual limit on out-of-pocket costs. These plans provide one-stop shopping, eliminating the need for separate supplemental insurance. Offered by major insurers, the plans also cover prescription drugs in most cases. But there are trade-offs. People joining a Medicare Advantage plan generally must accept limits on their choice of hospitals and doctors as well as prior insurer approval for certain procedures. If they change their minds and decide to return to traditional Medicare, they’re not always guaranteed supplemental “Medigap” coverage, which is also private. The president’s order is basically a to-do list for the Department of Health and Human Services that will require months of follow-up. Among the other priorities are an expansion of telemedicine and changes to avoid overpaying for procedures just because they get done in a hospital instead of a doctor’s office. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Trump’s order directs his department to examine whether its current policies and practices put traditional Medicare ahead of the private Medicare Advantage option. Some advocates for older people say that it’s the other way around and that the administration is trying to put private plans ahead. The executive order does not involve a major overhaul of Medicare, which would require congressional approval. So far the debate about Medicare for All has mainly been about its projected costs to the government, estimated at $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years. The Sanders plan would eliminate most private health insurance, including the Medicare Advantage option. Sanders, who unexpectedly underwent a heart procedure this week, says Medicare for All would nonetheless offer seniors broader benefits and lower costs. Sanders’ style of single-payer health care has long been popular among liberals. But recent polling has shown that a majority of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic prefer expanding coverage by building on the Affordable Care Act, or the Obama-era health law. Trump is asking federal courts to overturn that law as unconstitutional. As a presidential candidate, Trump promised not to cut Medicare. As president, he has avoided calling for privatization of the program, raising the eligibility age beyond 65 or rolling back benefits. But Trump’s latest budget proposed steep cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals and other service providers, prompting protests from the industry and accusations by Democrats that he was going back on his promises to seniors. The Medicare cuts went nowhere in Congress. ___ Alonso-Zaldivar reported from Washington. Associated Press writer Deb Riechmann in Washington contributed to this report.","New Study Reveals Alarming Increase in Mental Health Issues during COVID-19 Lockdowns

A recent study conducted by leading mental health experts has revealed a disturbing rise in mental health issues among individuals during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The research, which surveyed thousands of people across different age groups and backgrounds, highlights the severe consequences of prolonged isolation and the impact it has on psychological well-being.

The study found that the extended periods of social distancing have had profound effects on mental health, with feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness becoming prevalent among those surveyed. As individuals were confined to their homes, the lack of social interaction triggered a sense of isolation and left many struggling to cope with the sudden disruption to their lives.

One of the most significant findings from the study was the alarming increase in reported cases of anxiety. A staggering 67% of participants reported experiencing heightened levels of anxiety since the start of the lockdown measures. The anxieties were mainly related to fears regarding personal health, financial instability, and uncertainties about the future.

Furthermore, the research shed light on the shocking rise in depression rates. Over 50% of respondents admitted to showing symptoms of depression, including persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, and difficulties in concentrating. The absence of regular routines, limited access to outdoor spaces, and reduced social support networks have contributed to this widespread sense of desolation.

Loneliness has also become a prevailing issue during these prolonged lockdowns. With restrictions on physical contact and the closing of public spaces, individuals have been deprived of vital connections with friends and family. The study revealed that nearly 80% of participants reported feeling lonely at some point during the lockdown, highlighting the detrimental impact of reduced social interactions on human well-being.

Interestingly, the study also uncovered the disproportionate effect of mental health issues on specific demographic groups. Young adults, who typically thrive on social interactions and are in the process of establishing their careers and independence, have been hit particularly hard. The study showed that individuals aged 18 to 24 experienced the highest rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness among all age groups.

Experts are urging governments and health authorities to prioritize mental health support in their pandemic response strategies. They advocate for increased access to mental health services, remote counseling options, and promoting awareness campaigns aimed at destigmatizing seeking help. Additionally, creating safe spaces where individuals suffering from mental health issues can openly discuss their experiences can make a significant difference in reducing the impact of prolonged lockdowns on mental well-being.

The importance of addressing mental health concerns during these challenging times cannot be understated. While the primary focus has rightly been on containing the spread of the virus and safeguarding physical health, it is crucial not to overlook the toll the pandemic has taken on our collective mental well-being. Neglecting this aspect could have far-reaching consequences, leading to a rise in long-term mental health problems if left unaddressed.

As we continue to navigate these uncertain times, it is imperative for societies to place mental health on an equal footing with physical health. By acknowledging and addressing the mental health challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, we can begin to support those affected and build a more resilient society that prioritizes the overall well-being of its citizens.",true

But the disease is spreading rapidly within the large migrant worker community, highlighting what rights groups say is a weak link in containment efforts.","The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Global Crisis Requiring Urgent Action

Now, more than ever, it is crucial for the global community to come together and take swift action to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The summary of this unprecedented crisis is clear: urgent measures are needed to control the spread of the virus, protect vulnerable populations, and ensure that healthcare systems can cope with the increasing demands.

Since its emergence in late 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread across the globe, infecting millions and claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands. Despite efforts to contain the virus through testing, contact tracing, and social distancing measures, it continues to wreak havoc on communities worldwide. We are now facing a race against time to slow down transmission rates and prevent healthcare systems from collapsing under the weight of this relentless virus.

At the heart of our struggle to combat COVID-19 lies the need for comprehensive and efficient testing. Testing allows for early detection and isolation of cases, preventing further spread within communities. Unfortunately, many countries still grapple with limited testing capacities, leading to missed infections and delayed response strategies. It is imperative that governments and health authorities make testing accessible to all, regardless of socioeconomic status, to accurately monitor the scale of the outbreak and implement appropriate containment measures.

Equally important is the protection of vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. The data consistently shows that these groups are at a higher risk of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19. Therefore, governments must prioritize their safety by implementing effective shielding strategies and ensuring they have access to quality healthcare services. This includes equipping hospitals and healthcare workers with essential resources like personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators to provide timely and adequate care for those in need.

Furthermore, the strain on healthcare systems cannot be understated. Overwhelmed hospitals and exhausted healthcare workers put everyone at risk and limit the capacity to care for COVID-19 patients effectively. Governments must invest in strengthening healthcare infrastructure, increasing the number of hospital beds, and expanding intensive care units. Alongside this, healthcare workers should be provided with the support they need, both mentally and physically, to continue their tireless efforts on the frontlines.

It is also crucial that governments and global health organizations collaborate on a unified response. The development and equitable distribution of safe and effective vaccines should be prioritized. International cooperation can ensure that resources are shared, research is coordinated, and vaccines reach those who need them most urgently. Additionally, sharing data and best practices can facilitate the identification of successful strategies implemented in different regions, enabling a more informed and efficient response to the pandemic as a whole.

As the world grapples with the devastating effects of COVID-19, there can be no room for complacency. We must recognize the urgency of the situation and act decisively to protect our communities. Implemented testing measures, ongoing protection of vulnerable populations, bolstering healthcare systems, and fostering international collaboration will be key to containing the virus and preventing future outbreaks.

The challenges are immense, but history has shown us the power of human resilience and collective action in the face of adversity. Let us unite, overcome our differences, and work together to overcome this global crisis. The time for action is now.",true
2813,Pig-killing PEDv virus moves into Canada.,"The Ontario government is investigating a hog farm in the province’s Middlesex County after a laboratory finding of the virus, Dr. Greg Douglas, chief veterinary officer for Ontario, said at a news conference. Middlesex County is in southern Ontario near the city of London. Separately, one of Canada’s biggest pork processors, Olymel LP, said tests also confirmed the virus at an unloading dock of its Saint-Esprit slaughter facility northeast of Montreal, Quebec. “What they have found in the U.S. is this virus is highly contagious,” Douglas said. “It has been very difficult for producers to absolutely mitigate the threat.”  PEDv - which causes diarrhea, vomiting and severe dehydration in hogs - has turned up in 23 of the 50 states since its discovery in the United States last April. The virus, which is already established in Europe and Asia, poses no threat to humans and is not a food safety risk, according to the Canadian Swine Health Board. Canada is the world’s third-largest pork shipper. There are no official figures for pigs lost to the disease, but U.S. hog industry analysts estimate 1 million to 4 million have died. The virus continues to spread in the United States, with a total of 2,394 confirmed cases in 23 states as of the week ended January 18, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN). As defined by the USDA, each diagnostic case could represent multiple animals at either a single farm site or several locations. An undisclosed number of pigs have died at the Ontario farm. Douglas said the farm is not under quarantine, but the farmer has agreed not to move pigs off it in the near term. Quebec and Ontario are Canada’s two biggest hog-producing provinces. Canadian hog farmers have been on high alert since the virus reached the United States last year, taking additional biosecurity measures such as washing out trucks returning from south of the border. But the spread to Canada was seen as just a matter of time. The virus can spread through contaminated pig feces on pigs, trucks, boots and clothing. Olymel spokesman Richard Vigneault said that, as a result of extra testing, the PED virus was discovered on Tuesday at the Quebec slaughter plant. The confirmed case did not affect production, he said in an interview with Reuters. PEDv has no known implications for international pork trade, said Martin Rice, executive director of the Canadian Pork Council. In June, however, Mexico restricted imports of live hogs from the United States because of the deadly virus.","New Variant of COVID-19 Detected in Several Countries

A new variant of the coronavirus has been detected in several countries, raising concerns among health experts and officials. The emergence of this variant, named Lambda, adds to the already existing list of worrisome strains such as Delta and Alpha. Preliminary data suggests that Lambda may be more contagious and potentially resistant to certain vaccines.

First identified in Peru in August 2020, the Lambda variant has since spread to over 30 countries across the globe. It is believed to be responsible for the surge in cases in South America and is now being closely monitored by health authorities worldwide. While it still remains less prevalent compared to other variants like Delta, its rapid spread in recent weeks has sparked fears of a potential fourth wave of infections.

Researchers at the University of Chile conducted a study to evaluate the lambda variant's behavior and transmissibility. They found that the variant was highly infectious and could evade neutralizing antibodies produced by vaccines such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca. However, it is important to note that further research is needed to conclusively determine the effectiveness of existing vaccines against Lambda.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has categorized Lambda as a ""Variant of Interest"" but stopped short of labeling it as a ""Variant of Concern"" like Delta. Nonetheless, the WHO has advised countries to monitor the situation closely and take necessary measures to prevent further spread, including ensuring high vaccination rates, maintaining social distancing, and promoting the use of face masks.

Health officials stress that the best defense against any variant of the virus remains vaccination. Current vaccines, although they may offer reduced efficacy against some variants, still provide a crucial layer of protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Therefore, it is imperative to continue ramping up vaccination efforts globally, especially in countries where the Lambda variant is gaining momentum.

Experts also underline the need for genomic surveillance and rapid testing to detect new variants early on. The Delta variant's rapid spread and devastating impact underscored the importance of promptly identifying and monitoring emerging strains to contain their transmission effectively.

In light of the emergence of new variants, authorities in various countries have tightened travel restrictions and implemented additional measures to limit the virus's spread. Screening protocols at airports and border crossings have been reinforced, and quarantine requirements for incoming travelers from high-risk regions have been enhanced.

While the Lambda variant continues to be closely studied, scientists remain concerned about the potential mutations and future variants that may arise. They stress the importance of continued adherence to public health measures such as mask-wearing, hand hygiene, and social distancing to mitigate the risk of infection and prevent the further proliferation of variants.

As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing pandemic, it is crucial for governments, healthcare systems, and individuals to remain vigilant and adaptable. By staying informed, following expert guidance, and getting vaccinated, we can collectively protect ourselves and others from the threats posed by existing and emerging COVID-19 variants.",true
8881,Thailand will override cancer drug patents.,"Chaiya, under pressure from health activists and doctors who campaigned to have him sacked, said declaring compulsory licenses on the drugs would save Thailand more than 3 billion baht ($100 million) over the next five years. “The findings have convinced me to go ahead with the CLs since the ministry’s policy is to give patients good access to quality drugs at cheap prices,” Chaiya said of the review by a panel of Health Ministry officials. The decision is a blow to major pharmaceutical companies which had lobbied hard to reverse the CL policy launched by the previous government appointed after a bloodless 2006 coup. The three drugs are Letrozole, a breast cancer medicine made by Novartis AG, the breast and lung cancer drug Docetaxel by Sanofi-Aventis, and Roche’s Erlotinib, used for treating lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancer. A license issued on a leukemia drug, Glivec, was cancelled last month after its maker, Novartis, agreed to supply it free to hundreds of Thai patients. Shortly after a democratically-elected government took power in February, Chaiya ordered the review of a policy he said was a “politically correct decision, but not legally correct”. At the time he said the government could afford the full cost of the drugs, if it meant avoiding trade retaliation by the United States, home to some of the world’s biggest drug firms. U.S. officials denied there were any plans to impose sanctions on Bangkok, although Thailand was placed on a watch list, meaning Washington believed its respect for patents had weakened. When Chaiya, a businessman with no medical training, fired the Health Ministry’s top official negotiating cheaper prices from foreign drug firms, outraged health activists and doctors launched a campaign to remove him. Chaiya said on Monday the ministry would buy cheaper versions of the cancer drugs from generic producers, such as Indian firms which already supply copy-cat HIV-AIDS medicines to Thailand. Under World Trade Organisation rules, countries can issue a compulsory license to make or buy generic versions of patented drugs deemed critical to public health as long as the medicines are meant for domestic use. Former Health Minister Mongkol na Songkhla overrode Merck’s AIDS drug Efavirenz in late 2006, arguing that Thailand could not afford patented drugs for a national health plan that covers about 80 percent of the country’s 63 million people. A few months later he did the same on a Sanofi-Aventis heart medicine and an AIDS drug made by Abbott Laboratories, which refused to register several new medicines in Thailand. Mongkol, who targeted the four cancer drugs weeks before he left office, has defended the CL policy against major drug firms which accused him of stealing their intellectual property rights.

The global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has been met with both progress and challenges as countries strive to vaccinate their populations and curb the spread of the virus. While significant strides have been made, there are still obstacles that need to be overcome in order to achieve widespread vaccination.

One of the main achievements in the vaccine rollout has been the development of effective vaccines in record time. The scientific community, working diligently for over a year, successfully produced several safe and highly efficacious vaccines. Countries around the world swiftly authorized these vaccines for emergency use, allowing for mass deployment.

The initial phase of vaccine distribution focused on healthcare workers and elderly individuals, who were at the highest risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. This approach aimed at mitigating the strain on healthcare systems and protecting those most vulnerable to the virus. Many countries, including the United States and numerous European nations, prioritized these high-risk groups and successfully vaccinated a substantial portion of their populations.

As the vaccine rollout continues, efforts have been made to include larger segments of the population. Governments have opened up vaccination centers, established mobile units to reach remote areas, and launched online registration portals to streamline the process. These initiatives have facilitated access to vaccines for millions of people, making significant progress towards achieving herd immunity.

However, despite these advancements, challenges persist. One major obstacle is the inequitable distribution of vaccines globally. Developed countries have been able to secure large quantities of doses, while poorer nations struggle to acquire an adequate supply. This stark disparity jeopardizes global efforts to control the pandemic, as outbreaks in one region can easily impact others through international travel. Initiatives, such as COVAX, have been implemented to address this issue by ensuring equitable access to vaccines for lower-income countries. Nonetheless, more resources and collaboration are needed to bridge the vaccine divide.

Another challenge faced during the vaccine rollout is vaccine hesitancy. Misinformation surrounding vaccines has fueled skepticism and reluctance among certain segments of the population.

As the fight against COVID-19 continues, health officials and scientists are increasingly concerned about the emergence of new variants of the virus. These variants, such as the highly transmissible Delta variant, have been causing spikes in cases worldwide and present new challenges in controlling the spread of the disease.

The Delta variant, first identified in India, has rapidly become the dominant strain in many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. It is estimated to be 60% more transmissible than the previously prevalent Alpha variant, which itself was significantly more contagious than the original strain of the virus.

One of the biggest concerns surrounding these variants is their ability to potentially evade immunity gained through vaccination or previous infection. Although current vaccines still provide a significant level of protection against severe illness and hospitalization, studies suggest that they may be slightly less effective against some variants compared to the original strain.

Health agencies around the world are now focused on studying these variants and monitoring their impact on vaccine effectiveness. Many are also emphasizing the need for widespread vaccination to minimize the chances of further mutations and the emergence of even more dangerous variants.

In response to the rising threat of the Delta variant, several countries have reinstated mask mandates and imposed travel restrictions. Some regions have also implemented localized lockdowns to contain outbreaks caused by this highly contagious variant.

Experts stress the importance of ongoing genomic surveillance to detect and track the spread of new variants. This enables public health officials to identify potential hotspots and take prompt action to control the transmission. Efforts are underway to enhance global cooperation and information sharing to ensure a coordinated response to these emerging threats.

In addition to the Delta variant, other variants of concern include the Beta variant, first detected in South Africa, and the Gamma variant, initially identified in Brazil. These variants have shown resistance to certain monoclonal antibody treatments, leading to concerns about their potential impact on treatment strategies.

As the Delta variant continues its rapid spread, there have been growing calls for individuals to take necessary precautions, especially in regions with low vaccination rates. In these areas, the risk of outbreaks and potentially overwhelming healthcare systems looms large.

Public health officials urge people to continue practicing good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing, wearing masks in crowded indoor settings, and maintaining physical distance when possible. Vaccination remains a crucial tool in combating the virus, and outreach efforts are targeting populations that may still be hesitant or have limited access to vaccines.

Although these variants present new challenges in the battle against COVID-19, scientists and researchers remain optimistic. Many vaccine manufacturers are already developing booster shots specifically designed to enhance protection against existing and future variants. Ongoing research will shed further light on the effectiveness of these strategies and help guide public health policies in the months ahead.

In this ever-evolving pandemic landscape, it is essential to stay informed and adapt our behavior accordingly. As we navigate these uncertain times, the collective effort of governments, healthcare professionals, and individuals adhering to safety measures will be crucial to overcome the challenges posed by these variants and bring an end to the devastating impact of COVID-19.",true
7448,Seattle sees 1st case of childhood disease tied to virus.,"The disease being called “pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome” was identified and treated at Seattle Children’s Hospital, KUOW reported. King County Public Health said the patient was a resident of Snohomish County and there have been no other confirmed cases in the area. It involves a “hyper response” of the child’s immune system to the virus, according to Dr. Michael Portman, who directs pediatric cardiovascular research at Children’s. It can lead to inflammation of the blood vessels, and affect the heart’s arteries, leading to coronary aneurysms. In similar diseases, that can lead to lifelong heart issues, Portman said. The syndrome is rare and most children infected with the virus develop only mild illness. The disease is being linked to COVID-19, Portman said, because almost all of the patients have had confirmed cases of the virus, positive antibody tests, or known exposure. Portman said it is very similar and at times appears almost identical to a disease called “Kawasaki disease,” which was identified in Japan in the 1960s. According to Portman, Kawasaki disease is fairly common at Seattle Children’s. Around 30% patients at Children’s with Kawasaki disease are of Asian descent, Portman said. But the disease “seems to affect Hispanic and black children more severely” due to a “more robust inflammatory response.” Most of the cases of the new syndrome have been in the New York area and a handful have been fatal. Portman’s advice to parents is “not to freak out,” but if a child has a persistent fever, which is a symptom, he recommends getting it checked.","New Variant of COVID-19 Detected in Several Countries Raises Concerns Over Increased Transmissibility

A new variant of the novel coronavirus, known as B.1.617.2 or the Delta variant, is causing a surge in infections and raising alarms among health officials worldwide. This highly transmissible variant was first identified in India but has since spread to several countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, and Australia.

Health experts are closely monitoring the Delta variant due to its potential to disrupt efforts to control the pandemic. Research suggests that this variant is significantly more contagious than previous strains, making containment measures even more crucial in affected regions. Preliminary data from various studies indicate that the Delta variant may be up to 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) previously detected in the UK.

The increased transmissibility of the Delta variant presents a significant challenge in curbing the spread of the virus, especially in areas with low vaccination rates. Experts fear that if left uncontrolled, this variant could lead to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and potentially undo the progress made in reducing infection rates.

Countries grappling with the Delta variant have been prompted to implement stricter public health measures. The UK, for instance, has delayed plans to lift all remaining restrictions by extending mask mandates, enforcing social distancing, and encouraging people to work from home where possible. Furthermore, local lockdowns have been reintroduced in hotspot areas to contain outbreaks linked to this highly contagious variant.

Vaccination remains a crucial tool in combating the Delta variant. Multiple studies suggest that two doses of the available vaccines provide substantial protection against this new strain. However, the effectiveness of a single dose appears to be significantly lower compared to previous variants. Health authorities are therefore emphasizing the importance of completing the full vaccine regimen to ensure maximum protection.

In response to the rising threat posed by the Delta variant, countries are ramping up their vaccination efforts. Initiatives such as accelerated vaccine rollouts, expanded eligibility criteria, and increased vaccine supply are being implemented to expedite inoculations and curb the spread of the variant. Additionally, governments are working to address vaccine hesitancy by raising awareness about the importance of vaccination and dispelling misinformation.

Health officials also stress the need for continued adherence to preventive measures such as wearing masks, practicing good hand hygiene, and maintaining physical distance, even among fully vaccinated individuals. While vaccines offer substantial protection against severe illness and hospitalization, breakthrough infections can still occur, particularly with the Delta variant's heightened transmissibility.

Surveillance and genomic sequencing capabilities are being strengthened globally to better understand the prevalence and impact of the Delta variant. Increased monitoring is crucial in quickly identifying new outbreaks and implementing targeted interventions to prevent further transmission.

Overall, the emergence of the Delta variant underscores the ongoing threat posed by COVID-19 and highlights the importance of remaining vigilant. As efforts to control the pandemic continue, it is vital for individuals to stay informed about public health guidelines and actively participate in vaccination campaigns to safeguard themselves and their communities against this highly contagious variant.",true
1928,"After knee repair, half can't play sports the same.","""Of more than 300 men and women who had the surgery, a third stopped playing sports entirely and 68 who were still active said they didn’t play as well as before, researchers reported in the American Journal of Sports Medicine. The anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, is the ligament inside the knee that helps keep the joint stable. About 150,000 ACL injuries occur each year in the United States. “Less than 50 percent of the study sample had returned to playing sport at their preinjury level or returned to participating in competitive sport when surveyed at 2 to 7 years after ACL reconstruction surgery,” wrote Clare Ardern at La Trobe University in Victoria, Australia, who led the study. Ardern and her colleagues followed more than 300 men and women for two to seven years. Participants had either played Australian-rules football, basketball, netball or soccer before their surgeries. At 39 months post-surgery, 208 out of the 314 people who had the operation were still playing a sport, the researchers said. Of those 208, 68 said they played at a lower level than before their injury and 140 said they played about the same as before their injury. The remaining 106 participants either were not playing sports or did not complete the entire study. “Although almost all people returned to playing some form of sport, they did not play continuously for many years after their surgery,” Ardern told Reuters Health in an email. She also noted there may be other reasons why people stopped playing sports, such as fear of getting injured again or less confidence in performing. Of the 196 people who played competitive sports before their injury, 91 returned to their competitive sport. “This is a big injury,” said Edward McDevitt, a spokesman for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, who was not part of the study. “Many athletes who choose surgery have a long and difficult road to face. If you’re not willing to go through it, then you might be better off just getting a brace.”   He added that while knee surgery does allow people to return to their sport, they couldn’t perform as well as doctors might wish. People who tear the ACL can either opt for physical therapy and surgery or just physical therapy alone. “Some people find that they are able to function well without surgery, provided they have adequate leg strength to support the injured knee,” Ardern said. “Other alternatives may be to avoid sports involving direction changes, jumping and landing or activities that make the knee feel unstable, or use knee braces and supports.”   McDevitt speculates that after surgery, some athletes may not have the same range of motion, preventing them from playing as before.

A groundbreaking new study has revealed the impressive effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing hospitalizations and deaths caused by the virus. The research, conducted by a team of scientists from reputable institutions, provides further evidence of the crucial role vaccination plays in curbing the impact of the global pandemic.

The study analyzed data from over one million individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 between March and August of this year. Among these cases, the researchers compared outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals to determine the extent to which the vaccines protect against severe illness and fatalities.

The findings were striking. The study showed that fully vaccinated individuals had an approximately 90% reduced risk of being hospitalized due to COVID-19 compared to those who had not received any doses of the vaccine. Moreover, the vaccines were also highly effective in preventing deaths, with a reduction in mortality risk of about 80% among fully vaccinated individuals.

Dr. Emily Johnson, lead researcher on the project, emphasized the significance of these results. ""Our study provides strong evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe illness and death,"" she stated. ""These findings underscore the importance of widespread vaccination efforts to control the ongoing pandemic.""

The study further analyzed breakthrough cases among fully vaccinated individuals to assess the severity of illness in those rare instances. It found that while breakthrough infections can still occur, vaccinated individuals had milder symptoms and lower rates of hospitalization compared to their unvaccinated counterparts.

""These findings highlight the critical role of vaccination in reducing the burden on healthcare systems,"" said Dr. Johnson. ""Even if fully vaccinated individuals do contract the virus, they are significantly less likely to require hospitalization, ensuring that resources can be allocated to those who need them most.""

In addition to assessing the overall effectiveness of the vaccines, the study investigated the impact of different vaccine types. It revealed similar levels of protection across various vaccine platforms, demonstrating that all authorized vaccines significantly reduce the risk of severe illness and death.

The research team also examined potential differences in vaccine effectiveness against emerging variants. While their analysis found slightly decreased efficacy against certain variants compared to the original virus strain, the vaccines still provided substantial protection. This finding supports ongoing efforts to vaccinate as many individuals as possible, reducing viral transmission and ultimately minimizing the emergence of new variants.

Dr. Johnson warned against complacency amidst rising concerns of waning immunity over time and the threat of new variants. ""Continuous monitoring, booster vaccinations, and adherence to other public health measures will remain crucial tools in our fight against the virus,"" she cautioned.

These study findings come at a critical moment as countries race to vaccinate their populations and control the spread of COVID-19. They emphasize the importance of vaccination not only for personal protection but also for the collective well-being of communities. As governments and health authorities work to overcome vaccine hesitancy, this research provides invaluable evidence to reinforce the life-saving benefits of COVID-19 vaccines.

In light of these results, experts urge individuals who are eligible for vaccination but have not yet received their shots to do so without delay. By taking this vital step, we can protect ourselves and others, alleviate pressure on healthcare systems, and move closer to ending the global pandemic once and for all.",true

Clinton boiled her plan down to this: “Everybody who has health insurance who’s happy with it, you keep it. No changes. But what I am going to do is take an already existing plan -- it’s not government-run, it’s not a new bureaucracy. It’s the way Congress and federal employees get their health care. And we’re going to open it up to every American, because I think it’s about time...” “But you’re going to subsidize it,” O’Reilly interjected. “Well, we are,” Clinton said. “But here’s why. You already are subsidizing it. Your family policy has a $900 hidden tax. Why? Because when some poor person who doesn’t have health insurance...” “...goes to the emergency room...you’ve got to pick it up,” O’Reilly said, finishing her sentence. The $900 figure is key to Clinton’s plan. Yes, she is saying, the government will subsidize her health care plan. But, the thinking goes, private insurance companies will charge lower premiums to their existing customers because they will no longer have to subsidize health care costs incurred by uninsured people. Think of it like this, said John Sheils, senior vice president of The Lewin Group, a non-partisan group that has analyzed health care plans for both Democrats and Republicans: Someone shoplifts a loaf of bread from the grocery story. The price of bread is inflated a bit for everyone else to offset the store’s loss. “That’s kind of what’s going on with healthcare,” Sheils said. Hospitals have to treat people who come in and need medical care. And if those people don’t pay, “it’s kind of like walking out of the story without paying for bread,” he said. The cost is shifted onto those with private insurance. Sheils said Clinton’s claim that family health insurance policies subsidize the uninsured to the tune of about $900 a year is “in the ballpark.” Sheils believes the number is a little lower, closer to $800 per year. Hillary cites that same $900 figure in her formal health care proposal, the American Health Choices Plan. “One cause of the crisis in the health care system is that rather than containing costs, the system shifts them: about half of all hospital losses are passed along to other payers,” according to her plan. “Rather than reducing prices, the system raises families’ costs. “And, rather than covering all Americans, the system charges insured families a “hidden tax”: premiums are roughly $900 higher to pay for the cost of care for the uninsured.” It cites a report from Families USA called “Paying a Premium: The added cost of care for the uninsured.” The report was based on an analysis of data by Kenneth E. Thorpe, former Clinton administration health expert, now a professor at Emory University. Thorpe says Clinton’s figure actually is low. According to his analysis, about $922 of a family policy was used to subsidize the uninsured in 2005. But the cost of health care has gone up since then, as have the number of uninsured. In 2008, the number is closer to $1,270, he said. “The only way for hospitals to offset the costs (of the uninsured) is to have private insurers pay more than it’s worth,” Thorpe said. “It is their only means to stay financially solvent.” In 2005, private health paid about 25% more than the cost of care in hospitals, Thorpe said, citing a Medicare Payment Advisory Commission report to Congress. O’Reilly didn’t contest Clinton’s numbers, but he did take umbrage with subsidizing other people’s health care. “I mean, I don’t want to be paying for someone who’s taking heroin and drinking a bottle of gin a day,” O’Reilly said. “But I assume you want to pay for some hardworking families whose kid has juvenile diabetes,” Clinton said. “Or some woman... that just gets diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis."""" “I don’t mind doing it,” O’Reilly said. Clinton’s point was that, to an extent, family health policy holders already are shouldering some of the burden for the uninsured. There may be some debate about whether the number is exactly $900 a year, as she stated, but several health policy experts agreed that she’s at least close.""","COVID-19 Variants Pose New Challenges for Public Health 

Over the past year, the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic has witnessed various ups and downs. Just as vaccines provided a glimmer of hope, new and more contagious variants of the virus have emerged, posing fresh challenges for public health officials worldwide.

One of the most concerning variants is the B.1.1.7 strain, commonly known as the UK variant. This variant was first identified in the United Kingdom and has since spread to many countries, including the United States. Researchers have found that the UK variant is significantly more transmissible than earlier strains of the virus, making it easier for the virus to spread rapidly through communities.

Another variant that has caught the attention of scientists is the B.1.351 strain, originating from South Africa. Preliminary studies indicate that this variant may be resistant to some of the antibodies generated by previous COVID-19 infections or even vaccination. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of current vaccines against this particular strain, highlighting the need for ongoing research and development of vaccines that can effectively combat emerging variants.

While these two variants have garnered significant attention, it is important to note that several other variants with distinct genetic mutations have been identified across different regions of the world. The commonality among these variants is their potential to spread more easily than earlier strains, leading to an increased number of cases and placing additional strain on healthcare systems.

How should the public health response adapt to these new challenges? First and foremost, experts emphasize the importance of following basic preventive measures such as wearing masks, practicing physical distancing, and frequent handwashing. Despite the emergence of these new variants, these tried-and-tested measures remain effective in reducing transmission rates and protecting individuals from infection.

In addition to individual actions, governments and health agencies must ramp up efforts to track and monitor the presence of these variants within their populations. This requires robust genomic surveillance, identifying and sequencing the virus from as many positive cases as possible. By understanding the prevalence and spread of different variants, authorities can tailor public health interventions and deploy resources where they are most needed.

The ongoing vaccination campaigns provide hope in the battle against these new variants. Although concerns have been raised about the efficacy of current vaccines against certain strains, preliminary data suggests that vaccines continue to be effective in preventing severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by these variants. Continued research into vaccines and their potential adjustments to target emerging strains is crucial to staying ahead of the virus.

As new variants continue to emerge, it is essential that public health responses remain agile and adaptable. This means regularly updating guidance based on the latest scientific evidence and maintaining transparent communication with the public. It also underscores the importance of international cooperation and collaboration in monitoring and responding to the evolution of the virus across borders.

While the emergence of new COVID-19 variants poses significant challenges, the global community has faced adversity before and emerged stronger. With proactive measures, scientific advancements, and a united effort, we can navigate through these challenges and eventually overcome the pandemic. As we move forward, the key will be to stay informed, remain vigilant, and work together towards a healthier and safer world for all.",true
3380,Missouri agency requests state money to fight fatal disease.,"The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said the state’s response to the disease has grown and that current state laboratory staff are unable to complete all duties, according to documents submitted to state budget officials. As of July, 812 people in the state had contracted Legionnaires’ since 2014 and 44 had died, according to the health department. Missouri officials requested funding for a lab scientist and want the state to hire two environmental public health specialists and one epidemiology specialist, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. They would handle fieldwork duties and an influx of Legionella testing samples. The budget line would cost $320,057, which includes travel, training and other expenses, the department said. The DHSS’s request is based partly from new federal guidelines that requires individuals diagnosed with Legionnaires’ be questioned about visits to facilities and public venues 14 days prior to their illness, instead of the current 10-day time frame. The new rule “will substantially grow the staff time that will be dedicated to assessment and investigation,” the DHSS said, adding that existing staff had collected 500 Legionella samples and conducted 60 field inspections of implicated facilities this year. “However, DHSS has no dedicated staff to conduct the environmental health activities tied to Legionnaires’ Disease cases,” the department noted. “As the rigor and intensity associated with Legionella response has grown, existing staff have absorbed more duties.” New testing capabilities introduced in June for potable and non-potable water, and other environmental samples, have led to a surge in testing samples, the department said. “Subsequent to making this testing capability available, the demand for testing has increased well beyond projections,” the budget request said. The State Public Health Laboratory “is unable to provide the necessary Legionella testing to support significant public health investigations in Missouri on an ongoing basis.”","COVID-19 Vaccines: Boosting Confidence and Overcoming Hesitancy

As the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the ongoing rollout of vaccines has been a promising development. However, an emerging hurdle presents itself: vaccine hesitancy. Despite the availability of safe and effective vaccines, a significant portion of the population remains skeptical about receiving the shot. It is essential to address this issue head-on by boosting confidence and providing accurate information to dispel misconceptions.

One prevalent concern among vaccine skeptics is the rapidity at which the vaccines were developed. The development and approval process, although expedited, adhered to rigorous safety protocols. The unprecedented collaboration between scientific communities, government agencies, and vaccine manufacturers enabled the acceleration without compromising safety. In addition, extensive clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants showcased the vaccines' efficacy and minimal side effects. By emphasizing the diligence and transparency in the development process, public health officials can instill trust in those who are hesitant.

Another common misconception is the belief that obtaining natural immunity by contracting the virus is superior to vaccination. While it is true that individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 develop some level of immunity, the duration and strength of this immunity vary widely among individuals. Moreover, contraction of the virus carries the risk of severe illness, long-term complications, and in some cases, death. Vaccine-induced immunity, on the other hand, has been scientifically proven to provide a consistent and reliable safeguard against the virus. Educating the public about the benefits of vaccination over natural immunity will help alleviate concerns.

Misinformation circulating on social media platforms is further fueling vaccine hesitancy. False claims range from unsubstantiated reports about severe side effects to baseless conspiracy theories. Such misinformation erodes trust and contributes to fear and uncertainty. Public health organizations and credible news sources must combat these falsehoods by disseminating clear, evidence-based information in accessible formats. Fact-checking initiatives and collaborations with social media platforms are crucial in countering the spread of misinformation.

One demographic that warrants particular attention is communities of color. Historic injustices and racial disparities in healthcare have contributed to legitimate mistrust within these groups. Recognizing this, efforts to address vaccine hesitancy should involve actively engaging with community leaders, organizations, and healthcare providers. The inclusion of diverse voices in vaccine campaigns, paired with targeted education that addresses specific concerns, can help rebuild trust and ensure equity in vaccine distribution.

Some individuals are concerned about potential long-term side effects of the vaccines. While it is true that the vaccines have been developed relatively quickly, monitoring for adverse events continues even after approval. Robust post-vaccination surveillance systems are in place to detect and investigate any untoward effects. In reality, the risk of adverse events related to the vaccine is minimal compared to the substantial benefits gained from protection against COVID-19. Emphasizing the rigorous monitoring and reporting systems will help allay fears surrounding long-term safety.

To encourage broad participation in vaccination efforts, it is vital to ensure equitable access to vaccines. Communities with limited resources or marginalized populations must not be left behind. Governments, together with international organizations, should prioritize fair distribution strategies that target underserved communities. Addressing social determinants of health, such as transportation barriers and vaccine site accessibility, is essential to ensuring everyone has an equal chance to receive the vaccine.

In conclusion, while COVID-19 vaccines offer a pathway out of the pandemic, overcoming vaccine hesitancy is crucial for their efficacy. Clear and accurate communication about the safety, benefits, and importance of vaccination, along with equitable distribution, is key. By addressing the concerns of skeptics, combating misinformation, and fostering trust through community engagement, we can bolster confidence in the vaccines and protect public health.",true
12768,"""Donna Howard Says condoms """"used to be tax-exempt here in Texas.""","""An Austin legislator talking up her proposal to exempt feminine hygiene products from the state sales tax asserted that condoms were sold tax-free in Texas for a spell. Democratic state Rep. Donna Howard, speaking to reporters for the Dallas Morning News during a Facebook Live presentation, brought up condom tax history just after suggesting that ever-costly diapers also should not be subject to the state sales tax of 6.25 percent; local governments are allowed to levy up to 2 percent more of sales tax. Condoms, Howard went on, """"used to be tax-exempt here in Texas until we changed something in the statute; the wording was such that it ... put them back out there where they were taxed."""" We wondered about that, ultimately finding changes in law against a governor’s wishes resulted in a type of condom not being subject to sales tax for more than seven years--though no longer. To gauge this claim, we mostly relied on the Texas state comptroller’s office, which oversees state tax collections. By email, spokeswoman Lauren Willis pointed out that a tax-cut package signed into law by Gov. George W. Bush in 1999 included language exempting condoms from the Texas sales tax. Bush’s desire, comptroller’s ruling That’s what was reported at the time, we confirmed, though the tax details rest on a medical angle. Willis emailed us a web link to a March 2000 news story stating that contrary to Bush’s campaign-trail intentions, condoms would soon rank among products not subject to the state sales tax. Starting April 1, 2000, the Morris News Service story said, """"Texans won't have to pay sales tax on non-prescription medications, ointments to treat sunburns, laxatives or condoms."""" Before his re-election in 1998, the story said, Bush had proposed a $400 million tax-cut package including a sales tax break on over-the-counter health items although Bush, an advocate of abstinence education for teenagers, had said the cut wouldn’t apply to condoms. Seeking re-election, Bush said in September 1998 that his proposed tax cut would not extend to nonprescription contraceptives, including condoms, the Morning News reported. """"The governor is being touted by some in the GOP has a potential presidential candidate in 2000,"""" the story said, """"and some social conservatives have taken a strong stand against promiscuity and premarital sex."""" But in March 2000, State Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander announced she had no choice but to include condoms among items made tax-exempt in the tax-cut measure passed into law the year before. Calling her decision a """"matter of law,"""" Rylander pointed out the new law required a drug, medicine or health care product to be exempt from taxes if it has a drug code number issued pursuant to FDA regulations. National drug codes, or NDCs, are three-digit segments that serve as universal product identifiers, the FDA says. Condoms as medicinal A March 2000 Houston Chronicle news story said the legislated tax exemption would apply to all 100,000 nonprescription products carrying an NDC. That story noted that the original legislation, Senate Bill 441 by Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, would have exempted only children’s nonprescription medicines from the sales tax but was expanded in Senate-House negotiations to include adult over-the-counter medicines--with the FDA code limitation intended to preclude tax breaks for herbal and folk remedies not sanction by that agency. We confirmed, from SB 441 signed into law by Bush, the inclusion of language exempting from the sales tax any drug or medicine with an FDA-issued """"national drug code."""" We suspect, though, that not all condoms had the codes. When we checked with the FDA about condoms having NDCs, spokeswoman Deborah Kotz replied by email that the agency considers condoms to be """"devices"""" that don’t need NDCs, unlike medicines. Kotz later emailed that regardless, some condom manufacturers have put NDCs on condoms sold over the counter, """"often for reimbursement purposes."""" Some condoms, Kotz said, still have the numbers. Meantime, Willis shared a December 2000 letter from Rylander to a Victoria resident outlining another reason condoms became tax-exempt. Rylander wrote that as agency staff pinned down what would be exempt from the sales tax due to the 1999 law, they recognized that some drugs and medicines didn’t have NDCs. So in building the list of exempt items, Rylander advised, agency staff relied on an FDA list of drugs and medicines and also included items, such as condoms, that fit the state’s statutory definition of a drug or medicine as """"an article or substance applied to, ingested, or inhaled by humans marketed for the use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, illness, injury, or pain."""" Rylander’s conclusion: The """"medicated prophylactic devices, which aid in the prevention of disease, qualify for the exemption. However,"""" she wrote, """"prophylactic devices that are not medicated are not exempt."""" Willis confirmed, when we asked, that only condoms containing medication ended up being tax-exempt. No longer Lawmakers didn't immediately restore taxation of all condoms. Willis said, and we confirmed, that the NDC language was removed by a 2001 law yet Senate Bill 1125 left spermicidal condoms tax-exempt by simultaneously adding language exempting products """"labeled or required to be labeled with a ‘Drug Facts’ panel in accord"""" with FDA regulations. By email, Klot separately told us condoms, mostly regulated as devices and not medicines, might have """"facts"""" panels, but the FDA hasn’t required as much. A 2007 change in law limited items exempt from the sales tax to products required to have the """"Drug Facts"""" panels, Willis told us by email, which ended the condom tax exemption as of September 2007. In the fiscal year through August 2016, Willis said, the state sales tax on condoms yielded an estimated $7 million in revenue. Our ruling Howard said condoms """"used to be tax-exempt here in Texas."""" Under a tax-cut measure approved by lawmakers and Bush in 1999, condoms containing spermicide were exempt from the state sales tax starting in April 2000. Another change in law ended that exemption as of September 2007. – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.","New Drug Shows Promising Results in COVID-19 Treatment

A new drug has emerged as a potential game-changer in the fight against COVID-19. Early clinical trials have shown that the experimental medication, codenamed AZX-020, significantly reduces the severity of symptoms and shortens the duration of illness in infected patients.

Developed by a team of researchers at PharmaCo, AZX-020 is an antiviral drug specifically designed to target the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for causing COVID-19. In preclinical studies, the drug showed promising results by inhibiting viral replication and preventing the virus from entering host cells.

The phase 1 trial, involving a small group of healthy volunteers, demonstrated no serious adverse effects or safety concerns. Encouraged by these preliminary findings, the research team proceeded to conduct a phase 2 trial involving a larger cohort of COVID-19 patients.

During the phase 2 trial, which included individuals with mild to moderate symptoms, half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive AZX-020 while the other half received a placebo. The results were astonishing - patients who received the drug experienced a significant reduction in symptom severity and recovered faster compared to those who received the placebo.

Dr. Lisa Anderson, the lead researcher on the study, expressed her excitement about the initial findings. ""This is a breakthrough moment in our fight against COVID-19,"" she said. ""AZX-020 has shown remarkable efficacy, especially in reducing the time it takes for patients to recover.""

The trial's data revealed that patients treated with AZX-020 had an average symptom duration of 7 days, whereas patients in the placebo group experienced symptoms for an average of 12 days. Additionally, patients receiving the drug reported milder symptoms overall, leading to fewer hospitalizations and complications related to the disease.

These promising results have prompted the researchers to initiate a phase 3 trial, which will involve a larger and more diverse group of participants. If the subsequent trials confirm the drug's efficacy and safety profile, AZX-020 could be approved for emergency use by regulatory authorities around the world, offering a much-needed weapon in the battle against COVID-19.

However, experts caution that the drug's availability on a global scale may take time, even if it demonstrates favorable results in the upcoming trials. Manufacturing, distribution, and ensuring equitable access to the medication are challenges that must be addressed. Furthermore, the researchers stress that AZX-020 should not be seen as a substitute for vaccination or public health measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing.

Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies and governments are closely monitoring the progress of AZX-020 and are already engaging in discussions regarding production and distribution agreements. The hope is that if AZX-020 proves its worth, it can be an additional tool in curbing the spread of COVID-19 and helping countries recover from the devastating impact of the pandemic.

As the world continues to navigate the ongoing crisis, developments like AZX-020 offer a glimmer of hope. However, it is essential to remember that further studies are necessary to confirm the drug's potential benefits fully. Until then, adhering to public health guidelines and getting vaccinated remain crucial in our collective efforts to overcome COVID-19.",true

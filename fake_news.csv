9940,Heart failure therapy twice as effective in women,"February 8, 2011","The story didn’t deliver the numbers and the explanations to help readers evaluate the evidence. It is not clear from the story what ‘a 70% reduction in heart failure compared with a 35% decline in men’ actually means. The story went on to mention a ‘dramatic’ reduction in cause of death from any cause. But what does that mean? How big is a ‘dramatic’ reduction? Heart disease (coronary artery disease) and heart failure are common, age-related conditions. Providing readers with accurate information that they can use in their decision making process about treatments is valuable. This story just didn’t click on all cylinders.", ,"There was no discussion of costs. These things are not cheap. In this story, the ‘result’ of the combination device in men was described as ‘good’ as compared to women in whom the benefit was described as ‘fantastic’ . What exactly was the ‘result’ the clinician was describing, and then how does ‘good’ compare to ‘fantastic’? Is the difference statistically significant or clinically meaningful? Similarly – ‘a dramatic reduction in heart failure events’ – what is the nature of these ‘events’ ? And then lastly – opening with the information that women had ‘a 70% reduction in heart failure compared with a 35% decline in men’ fails to provide the reader with any insight about what was being measured and because only the relative change is presented rather than the absolute difference – readers have no idea about that actual size of the difference. There was no discussion of potential harms from the use of the device. Other than providing the name of the trial (MADIT-CRT) and its source of funding (Boston Scientific) the story provided insufficient information to readers to help them evaluate the quality of the evidence. It is not clear what ‘a 70% reduction in heart failure compared with a 35% decline in men’ actually means. The writer probably meant reduction in heart failure related hospitalizations. But without this information the statement is not able to be interpreted. The story went on to mention a ‘dramatic’ reduction in cause of death from any cause. While this seems like a potentially good thing – how big is a ‘dramatic’ reduction? The story ended with disease mongering about the 42 million American women ‘living with heart disease’ in a story about heart failure, which, while it may fall under the rubric of heart disease, is only a subset of the vast 42 million. The story then went on to share that ‘It’ is the ‘leading killer of women’. Why not simply provide heart failure stats, and heart failure stats by gender? No independent sources were cited or quoted. The story did mention that the study reported on was funded by the manufacturer of the device discussed. There was no discussion about alternatives. At the end of the story, it mentioned that what it earlier referred to as ‘a combination pacemaker and defibrillator device’ had had it use expanded by ‘U.S. regulators’ to include mild heart failure. It seemed clear from the story that the combination device was not new but that its use had recently been expanded. We’re going to rule this Not Applicable because it’s an odd case. Different quotes are attributed to the researcher – some from “a statement” and some from a telephone interview. We can’t be sure how much original reporting was done. An older press release (June 2010) may have been the source for some of the information presented in this story. http://bostonscientific.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=932", ,false,"heart disease,Reuters Health,women's health"
38080, A British man named David Hibbitt was given 18 months to live before he cured cancer with cannabis oil. ,"January 17, 2018","Given 18 Months to Live, Man Cures Brain Cancer With Cannabis Oil",  Rich Buhler & Staff  ,"Many holistic health websites have featured the story of the man who cured bowel cancer with cannabis oil after being given 18 months to live. Unfortunately, 34-year-old David Hibbitt died from brain cancer in 2016, a year after stories about his miraculous recovery first surfaced. The story surfaced in the U.K.’s Metro newspaper in April 2015. The paper reported that Hibbitt had been “cured” after purchasing cannabis oil from a local dealer. But the initial story noted that there was no clinical evidence that cannabis oil could actually treat cancer: Cancer Research UK said it was aware of patients using cannabis extracts to treat themselves but there was ‘no good evidence’ from clinical trials to prove it was safe and effective. Natural health websites quickly picked the story up. It was held up as an example of the medicinal potential of cannabis oil, but Hibbitt died of cancer just one year after reports that he’d been “cured,” the Daily Mail reports: Last January the father-of-one revealed he was cancer-free and put the class-B drug down to his miracle recovery. But the cancer returned in March this year and spread to his lungs and brain. It claimed his life earlier this month. David Hibbitt’s family vowed to pursue research into the ability of cannabis oil to treat cancer after his death. There have been lots of studies about cannabinoids’ ability (or lack thereof) to treat cancer. But Cancer Research UK reports that there’s no definitive proof of that, despite numerous studies claiming to confirm that cannabis oil treats cancer.

23183,"""Planned Parenthood Says """"Scott Walker tried to pass a law to allow pharmacists to block women’s access to birth control.""","October 18, 2010",Planned Parenthood says Scott Walker tried to pass a bill to allow pharmacists block women’s access to birth control,Tom Kertscher,"""Planned Parenthood Advocates, the lobbying and political action arm of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, says it made more than 1.1 million """"voter contacts"""" in the 2008 elections. The Madison-based group, which supports pro-choice candidates, has also been working to influence voters in 2010 -- including pushing them to support Democrat Tom Barrett in the Nov. 2, 2010 election for governor. The group is painting Barrett’s rival, GOP nominee Scott Walker, as """"just too extreme."""" In a flier mailed to voters, it frames Walker’s views this way:  """"Scott Walker tried to pass a law to allow pharmacists to block women’s access to birth control."""" Is that really the case? Planned Parenthood Advocates spokeswoman Amanda Harrington said her organization’s statement about Walker is based on Assembly Bill 168, a measure Walker sponsored in 2001 while serving in the state Assembly. It would have applied to pharmacists and other health care providers, but it did not become law. The bill would have: Asked to respond to the Planned Parenthood Advocates flier, Jill Bader, spokeswoman for Walker’s gubernatorial campaign, said it was """"completely false"""" that the bill had anything to do with birth control. But news stories at the time described how Walker’s bill targeted RU-486, an abortion pill, and the """"morning-after"""" pill, which prevents a pregnancy. The articles also told how the proposal could have allowed pharmacists to refuse to dispense most other forms of birth control. """"Could"""" and """"most"""" are the operative words. But both Harrington and Matt Sande of Pro-Life Wisconsin say the protections for pharmacists in Walker’s bill would have applied to the dispensing of all types of birth control. Back to the claim about Walker. The claim does not address pills or devices, but rather how pharmacists would have been allowed to function had the bill become law. Planned Parenthood says flatly: Pharmacists would have been able to block women from getting birth control. In truth, the effects would have been more limited. An individual pharmacist could have refused to fill a particular birth control prescription. But women could have gotten the prescription filled by another pharmacist, perhaps at the same counter, or at another pharmacy. In many places, that might have amounted to an inconvenience, though in areas with few pharmacies, a refusal by one pharmacist could have created a bigger burden. As for the 2010 race, both candidates have given their views on the issue: Barrett says he opposes efforts to allow pharmacists to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions; Walker says he supports allowing pharmacists to refuse to fill emergency contraception prescriptions on moral grounds. The claim by Planned Parenthood is still off the mark. In an effort to paint Walker as extreme, the group’s lobbying arm says in a direct mail piece that Walker """"tried to pass a law to allow pharmacists to block women’s access to birth control."""" That bill might have made it more difficult for some women to get contraceptives at some pharmacies, depending on who was on duty. But words matter -- the possible narrowing of access to birth control in some cases isn’t the same as blocking it in all cases.""","https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lSsqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WzAEAAAAIBAJ&dq=scott%20walker%20the%20march%20of%20technology&pg=6609%2C1542948, http://www.prolifewisconsin.org/, http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2001/data/AB-168.pdf, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nCsqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WzAEAAAAIBAJ&dq=Panel%20backs%20bill%20on%20ethics&pg=6689%2C7753667, https://www.mayoclinic.com/health/medical-abortion/MY00819/DSECTION=what-you-can-expect, http://www.ppawi.org/home/news-media/newsroom/press-releases/PR060710.cmsx, http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/104221094.html, https://www.mayoclinic.com/health/morning-after-pill/MY01190, http://www.ppawi.org/media.acux/bd4560cb-e8a9-4c3e-8fd9-3bba80ff8dcd, http://ethics.state.wi.us/scripts/currentSession/oel.asp?PrinID=2970&start=P&start2=, http://www.wisdc.org/ind10-501002.php",false,"Health Care, Message Machine 2010, Women, Wisconsin, Planned Parenthood, "
16344,Jeanne Shaheen Says Scott Brown co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for mammograms.,"October 10, 2014","Shaheen said Brown co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for mammograms. The amendment, which Brown supported, was written loosely enough to allow a religious-conscience opt-out for almost any conceivable form of preventive care. But it didn't target mammograms, as Shaheen implied. And while the amendment would have protected religious-conscience objections, we failed to uncover any evidence that mammograms have inspired religious opposition, either now or in the past. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",Louis Jacobson,"""The U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire has been awash in claims about abortion and women’s health issues in recent days. One claim by incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen caught our eye. Shaheen is facing a challenge from former Republican Sen. Scott Brown. In a news release from her campaign, Shaheen said: """"I have always supported a woman’s right to choose because I know women should be making health care decisions in consultation with their doctors and their families, not their employer. Scott Brown’s record is clear: When it counts, he doesn’t stand up for women’s reproductive rights and economic security. He co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control or even mammograms. New Hampshire women can’t trust Scott Brown, and his record is move evidence that he is wrong for New Hampshire."""" We noticed two claims that are related, but distinct enough to analyze separately. First, would the legislation in question have allowed employers deny women coverage for birth control? And would it have allowed employers to deny coverage for mammograms? We’ve heard of controversies over birth control, but not mammograms. So we decided to check it out. (We’ve addressed birth control in a separate fact-check.) Mammograms are used to screen for breast cancer, either preventively in women who have no signs of the disease, or as a diagnostic aid after a lump or other symptom is reported, according to the National Cancer Institute. In a different Shaheen campaign news release, the campaign explained its sourcing by writing, """"FACT: Scott Brown both co-sponsored and voted for the Blunt Amendment that would let employers deny women access to a range of healthcare services, including contraception and coverage for mammograms."""" The amendment in question was proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. It was tabled -- that is, dispensed with -- by a 51-48 vote in which a simple majority was required. Among those who voted """"nay"""" -- that is, those who wanted to keep it under consideration -- was Brown, then representing Massachusetts in the Senate. He also co-sponsored a predecessor measure, S.1467, the Respect for Rights of Conscience Act of 2011. So Shaheen’s camp is correct that Brown acted in support of this measure. But what did the amendment say? It acted to widen the scope of acceptable actions for opting out of provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on religious or moral grounds. It focuses on mandates within the law for preventive services, called the """"essential health benefits package."""" The Shaheen campaign pointed us to a Feb. 29, 2014, news release opposing the Blunt Amendment by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. The release said, """"the expansive nature of the proposed Blunt amendment ... could result in coverage denials of life-saving preventive services such as mammograms or tobacco cessation based on employer discretion."""" But we aren’t accepting the claim of an advocacy group without digging further. So we read the relevant portions of the law ourselves. We agree that the provision is drawn broadly. It’s not targeted at abortion or birth control -- it simply says that employers cannot be required to cover """"specific items or services"""" that are """"contrary to the religious beliefs or moral convictions of the sponsor, issuer, or other entity offering the plan."""" So, presumably, any aspect of preventive care could qualify for a religious-conscience opt-out -- including mammograms. Or, for that matter, stethoscopes or tongue depressors. We can’t imagine any religious objections to the use of tongue depressors. But what about mammograms? We asked a number of experts in medicine and bioethics whether they had ever heard religious objections raised regarding mammograms. None said they had. """"I have not heard this claim in the specific context you describe,"""" said Paul A. Lombardo, a specialist in medical law and ethics at Georgia State University. Adam Sonfield, a senior public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute, noted that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissent in Hobby Lobby noted past religious objections to blood transfusions (by Jehovah’s Witnesses); antidepressants (by Scientologists); medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin (by certain Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations (by Christian Scientists). However, Sonfield couldn’t recall hearing objections to mammograms. Opposition to mammograms would also be news to a leading anti-abortion group, the National Right to Life Committee. """"I've never heard of any argument being made against mammograms based on a conscience objection,"""" said Susan T. Muskett, the group’s senior legislative counsel. Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center, said the closest he can get """"to making any sense of"""" the claim involves what in the game of pool would be known as a multiple bank shot. Here goes: Planned Parenthood has become a target of anti-abortion activists because it performs abortions, but the group’s clinics also provide other forms of health care to women. These include breast examinations, but not mammograms per se. If the clinic determines that a patient needs a mammogram, they will be referred to a health care provider that offers one. Some abortion opponents might """"see this as a ruse,"""" Caplan said. """"So there might be a doctor or a nurse who would refuse a mammogram referral from Planned Parenthood on the grounds that that they are just funding abortions."""" But this is all speculative, Caplan added. """"No doc I know of has any issue with mammograms,"""" he said. Holly Fernandez Lynch, a Harvard bioethicist and author of Conflicts of Conscience in Health Care: An Institutional Compromise, called the claim """"technically true"""" but """"a bit of a strawman."""" Could it have been used to deny access to mammograms? """"Yes,"""" she said. """"Would it have been? Almost certainly not. I have never heard of a religious or moral objection to mammograms. The better examples would have been contraceptives, abortion, vaccines (especially HPV), psychiatric care, or palliative care/hospices."""" Our ruling Shaheen said Brown co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for mammograms. The amendment, which Brown supported, was written loosely enough to allow a religious-conscience opt-out for almost any conceivable form of preventive care. But it didn't target mammograms, as Shaheen implied. And while the amendment would have protected religious-conscience objections, we failed to uncover any evidence that mammograms have inspired religious opposition, either now or in the past.

16991,"""Obamacare is """"one big fat VA system.""","May 22, 2014","""Guilfoyle said Obamacare is """"one big fat VA system."""" We found no health policy expert who agreed with that comparison. The VA is owned and operated by the federal government. Its staff are government employees. In contrast, Obamacare builds upon the existing private sector health industry. The law sets standards for insurance and health care providers and it subsidizes premiums. Washington does run the Medicaid insurance program but even under that program, it is paying private providers.""",Jon Greenberg,"""The uproar over allegations of secret waiting lists at a Veterans Administration hospital in Phoenix, and delays that potentially cost veterans their lives has opened the Obama administration to criticism that it was slow to respond to the VA’s own internal reports. Some also see a connection between troubles at the VA and the president’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act. On Fox News’ The Five, four of the show’s pundits built the case that if Obama digs deeply into the VA, it will raise more questions than he would like about how the Affordable Care Act is structured. When a Fox News panelist described the VA as a """"single-payer"""" system (where the financing of health care is run through the government), co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle chimed in. """"If he (Obama) shines a light on that, if we actually have some illumination there, then you're going to see this is really what the rest of you all are going to get: One big fat VA system in the form of Obamacare,"""" Guilfoyle said. Using the same logic, co-host Eric Bolling later claimed that 500 people per year """"are going to die waiting"""" for treatment because of Obamacare. Bolling’s claim has some fundamental problems -- we’ll address them in a bit -- but here we’re fact-checking Guilfoyle’s claim that Obamacare amounts to """"one big fat VA system."""" Obamacare: One big fat VA system The VA owns hospitals. Its doctors, nurses and technicians are government employees. The people who get care at VA facilities have served in the armed forces. These facilities are not open to the general public, and Congress appropriates the funds that keep the VA running. Under the Affordable Care Act, the government works with private insurance companies and health care providers to provide health care coverage. The government subsidizes insurance premiums for some people and sets minimum standards for insurance policies. But the health care system remains in the private sector. Private sector providers get paid by insurance companies and patients. There are thousands of private providers and hundreds of insurance plans operating in hundreds of markets across the country. In the case of Medicaid, the government plays the role of the insurance company and pays private providers based on a set reimbursement schedule. Some notes about the Affordable Care Act: Employers will continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies. The government has not seized control of hospitals or nationalized doctors. The law does not include the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers. We asked health care experts to assess the similarities and differences between the VA and the Affordable Care Act. The bottom line: it’s apples and oranges. Tom Buchmueller, who spent a year on Obama's Council of Economic Advisors and teaches at the University of Michigan, said he struggles to see any similarity at all. """"Coverage through the exchanges is private insurance,"""" Buchmueller said. Tom Getzen at Temple University said the VA is much like the institution that the veterans were once part of. """"It’s an army,"""" Getzen said. """"In contrast, Obamacare is a complex legislative creation (with) the exchanges, expanded Medicaid and regulation."""" Getzen said, to call Obamacare the same as the VA """"is kind of like saying your farm program is a post office."""" They both have government ties, but they’re fundamentally different and are operated differently. Scott Harrington, an adjunct scholar with the conseravtive American Enterprise Institute and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, described the changes under Obamacare as a step in the direction of a government-run health care system. """"But it’s a long way from getting there,"""" Harrington said. The idea that the Affordable Care Act was a """"government takeover of health care"""" was named as PolitiFact’s 2010 Lie of the Year. 500 people dying a year from Obamacare Bolling took the comparison a step further, saying the sort of delays that took place at the VA in Phoenix would repeat themselves under Obamacare, with 500 people dying a year as a result. """"President Obama wanted to insure 40 million new people under Obamacare,"""" Bolling said. At the VA, he continued, the typical veteran has 13 appointments each year. Bolling applied that to 40 million new patients. """"You're talking 585 million visits, half a billion visits,"""" Bolling said. """"If people are dying, how many people are going to die in Obamacare? Do the math. It will be about 500 people per year that are going to die waiting -- apples to apples."""" While we won’t fact-check Bolling’s prediction, we do think it’s important to point out two problems with Bolling’s math for people who saw the segment. First, the Congressional Budget Office projects that through 2024, 26 million people will gain coverage under the Affordable Care Act. So Bolling exaggerated the base number by about 50 percent. Second, the experts we reached said veterans have very different needs than the general population. Part of the massive growth in the VA workload stemmed from disorders related to traumatic brain injury and from the lingering effects of the Vietnam War defoliant Agent Orange. Bolling doubled or even tripled the number of doctor appointments of typical Americans, experts told us. """"The average in the U.S. is between four and six,"""" Getzen said. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the average number of visits fell from 4.8 a year in 2001 to 3.9 in 2010. Point being: The math Bolling used to reach his prediction is quite flawed. Our ruling Guilfoyle said Obamacare is """"one big fat VA system."""" We found no health policy expert who agreed with that comparison. The VA is owned and operated by the federal government. Its staff are government employees. In contrast, Obamacare builds upon the existing private sector health industry.

24508,Medicare officials have treated Humana and AARP inconsistently on how they can communicate with seniors.,"September 30, 2009","Humana is a Medicare contractor, AARP is not",Angie Drobnic Holan,"""A controversial mailing from Humana to Medicare recipients has Republicans charging unfair treatment in the way the government handled private insurance companies versus the AARP. The House Republican Conference said the government is silencing Humana about reforms that would change Medicare Advantage, while the AARP — a notable reform supporter — gets off scott-free. """"This week the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced it was investigating Humana for providing 'misleading' information regarding the administration's proposed cuts to Medicare Advantage policies — and prohibited other Medicare Advantage plans from providing similar information on how Democrat health 'reform' could take away their current coverage,"""" the release said. """"Yet the administration's edict prohibiting plans from communicating with their beneficiaries failed to include AARP, which sponsors a Medicare Advantage plan but has been a prime advocate of Democrats' government takeover of health care — quite possibly because AARP has been supporting a health care overhaul from which it stands to gain overall handsomely,"""" the statement said. We wanted to investigate whether there were two different standards at work. We found that AARP and Humana actually have very different roles with Medicare plans. AARP makes money by licensing its name to a private insurer that offers a Medicare Advantage plan. Humana is a different private insurer that takes money from the government to provide an Advantage plan. Humana contracts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in a program called Medicare Advantage. Often called Medicare's HMOs, Advantage is an optional program in which the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries. The program was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened, and Medicare Advantage actually costs the government more. President Barack Obama and groups like AARP have said it's time to bring the costs of Medicare Advantage in line with the cost of regular Medicare. Humana is the second-largest insurance company that handles Medicare Advantage, right after UnitedHealth Group. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that runs Medicare and is often referred to as CMS, recently announced it was looking into mailings that Humana sent to its Medicare Advantage and Part D patients. (Part D is Medicare coverage for prescription drugs.) """"We are concerned that the materials Humana sent to our beneficiaries may violate Medicare rules by appearing to contain Medicare Advantage and prescription drug benefit information, which must be submitted to CMS for review,"""" said Jonathan Blum, acting director of CMS's Center for Drug and Health Plan Choices. """"We also are asking that no other plan sponsors are mailing similar materials while we investigate whether a potential violation has occurred."""" According to the CMS, Humana's mailing warned beneficiaries that they might lose benefits under health care reform, a claim that Democratic officials dispute. The  Huffington Post  said it has obtained  a copy of the mailer  and posted it to its Web site. The impact of health care reform on Medicare recipients has been a matter of considerable debate. We examined a claim by President Barack Obama that  Medicare benefits would not be cut  and found it to be Half True. Experts told us basic benefits would stay in place but that it's conceivable or even likely that Medicare Advantage patients could see reduced benefits. In a letter to Humana, a CMS official said that Humana's communication could be considered """"misleading and confusing to beneficiaries"""" and might be construed as official Medicare communications. The House Republican Conference said CMS did not target the seniors' group """"quite possibly because AARP has been supporting a health care overhaul ..."""" Our research shows, however, that AARP has a very different relationship with its members than Humana does with seniors on Medicare Advantage. Here's how it works: AARP lends its name to insurance companies to sell policies specifically for AARP members. The insurance companies then pay AARP a fee for the policies they sell with the AARP name. AARP calls these payments royalties. (Read our story for more details on  AARP's royalties  .) AARP does profit indirectly from selling Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplemental policies, and it uses that money to fund its efforts as a nonprofit advocacy group. AARP partners with UnitedHealth on its Medicare plans. UnitedHealth is the No. 1 seller of Medicare Advantage, with 16 percent of the market, followed closely by Humana with 14 percent of the market, according to Mark Farrah Associates. So when AARP mails seniors, it's using its own private membership list for communication. Humana, on the other hand, is mailing people using personal information it receives as a government contractor. UnitedHealth would be bound by similar rules.

Based on public statements, Obama and CDC officials have repeatedly said there’s a chance an Ebola case could appear in the United States, but the possibility of an outbreak is extremely low. We found no instance in which an official said Ebola would """"never"""" make it here -- rather, it has always been acknowledged as a possibility.""",Lauren Carroll,"""Early Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced a second person had contracted Ebola in the United States. The patient is a female nurse in Dallas, who had treated the first patient diagnosed in the United States -- Thomas Eric Duncan, who came into contact with Ebola in Liberia, fell ill in Dallas and died there Oct. 8. The CDC believes the nurse, who had been taking CDC-mandated precautions, was exposed to Ebola because of a """"breach in protocol."""" The new case is fanning the fears of those who think the government is not doing enough to prevent an Ebola outbreak in the United States -- despite the CDC’s repeated assurances that it is highly unlikely the disease would spread here. In light of the news, the Sunday talk shows shifted from their scheduled topics to discuss the case. On CNN’s State of the Union, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. -- invited on the show to talk about U.S. military activity in Iraq -- said it’s not obvious to the public that anyone in the government is taking charge over Ebola. """"Americans have to be reassured here,"""" McCain said on Oct. 12, 2014. """"I don’t think we are comforted by the fact that we were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States, and obviously that’s not correct."""" At a press conference Sunday, CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said there’s a risk that the Dallas area might see additional cases in coming days because of this possible """"breach in protocol."""" However, the organization remains """"confident that wider spread in the community can be prevented."""" We decided to look back and see if any official said that a case of Ebola would """"never"""" come to the United States. Although many media outlets and health care officials have urged people not to panic about Ebola, we could not find a single instance where someone said it would """"never"""" get here. As far as we can tell, the CDC and the President Barack Obama’s message has been the same throughout the epidemic, which began in Africa in December: It’s possible a case might make its way to the United States, but a full-fledged outbreak is highly unlikely. (We reached out to McCain’s staff, but they never got back to us.) The administration’s reasoning: America’s health system is much better prepared to fight diseases like Ebola than those in places like Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the disease has been spreading. Here’s some of the CDC’s statements: July 28, after two Americans contracted the disease in Africa: """"There is no significant risk in the U.S. While it is unlikely that the disease would spread if imported into the United States, the recent infections in U.S. health care workers working abroad highlight the need for vigilance."""" (The CDC has issued periodic updates on Ebola since March, but this was the first one we could find that addressed the disease spreading to the United States.) Aug. 13, press release: """"A disease threat anywhere in the world is a threat everywhere in the world, and CDC is preparing for any possibility, including that a traveler might become ill with Ebola while in the United States. Although Ebola poses very little or no risk to the U.S. community at large, CDC and health care providers in the United States need to be prepared."""" Sept. 17, testimony at congressional hearing: """"We do not view Ebola as a significant public health threat to the United States. … It is possible that infected travelers may arrive in the United States, despite all efforts to prevent this; therefore we need to ensure the United States' public health and health care systems are prepared to rapidly manage cases to avoid further transmission."""" The White House: July 31, press briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest: """"The CDC has concluded that there is no significant risk in the United States from the current Ebola outbreak. And while it is unlikely that the disease would spread if the virus were detected in the United States, the CDC is taking action to alert health care workers in the U.S. and remind them how to isolate and test suspected patients while following strict infection control procedures."""" Sept. 16, Obama’s remarks at the CDC: """"First and foremost, I want the American people to know that our experts, here at the CDC and across our government, agree that the chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low."""" Oct. 8, Obama’s statement to state and local officials, after Duncan (the first Dallas patient) died: """"Because we’ve got a world-class medical system, because we’ve put in place tough safety measures, because of the work that many of you have done in conjunction with organizations like the CDC and dealing with infectious disease generally, and because of the nature of Ebola and the fact that it’s not something involving airborne transmission, the chance of an Ebola outbreak in the United States remains extremely low. … I’m confident that so long as we work together, and we’re operating with an appropriate sense of urgency that we will prevent an outbreak from happening here."""" The common refrain in all those comments? A widespread outbreak is extremely unlikely in the United States. But individual or isolated cases were possible, hence the need for the CDC to be ready. Our ruling McCain said, """"We were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States."""" Based on public statements, Obama and CDC officials have repeatedly said there’s a chance an Ebola case could appear in the United States, but the possibility of an outbreak is extremely low.

24487,Baseball and insurance are the only industries exempt from antitrust laws.,"October 13, 2009","Liberal group says health insurance, baseball are only industries exempt from antitrust laws",Louis Jacobson,"""Supporters of the Democratic health care plan have invoked baseball in their latest television ad that tries to demonize the health insurance industry. In the 30-second ad, the liberal group Americans United for Change asks, """"How are professional baseball and insurance companies alike? Baseball and insurance are the only industries exempt from antitrust laws. How are they different? Insurance industry executives are scared of competition. Baseball players aren't. When baseball players fix the games, they get in trouble. When health insurance executives fix the games, they get rich. Time for competition when it comes to health insurance. We need the choice of a public health insurance plan."""" In this item, we'll focus on their opening claim, that """"baseball and insurance are the only industries exempt from antitrust laws."""" Let's first explain what """"antitrust"""" means. Antitrust laws protect against anticompetitive conduct by cartels and monopolies. Federal antitrust laws target price-fixing, predatory pricing and mergers that reduce competition. Courts have consistently ruled that the federal government has the authority to pass laws that police competition in """"interstate commerce"""" — that is, business activity that crosses borders and ripples through the national economy. While federal antitrust laws do cover most industries, some are exempted, thanks either to the courts or Congress. The Americans United for Change ad cites what is probably the best-known exemption: baseball. Baseball's sweeping exemption stems from a 1922 U.S. Supreme Court decision. The justices, presented with an upstart league's lawsuit against the well-established National League, ruled that teams' travel across state lines was not """"essential"""" to the business. As a result, the justices ruled, the federal government had no antitrust power over baseball, since games were essentially events held in one state. Most notably, the exemption allows Major League Baseball to prevent teams from moving without the league's consent. In more recent challenges, the high court declined to overturn baseball's exemption, saying it was up to Congress to rescind it. Despite numerous bills, lawmakers have so far declined to do so. So, the ad is correct that baseball has an antitrust exemption. Does insurance have one too? It does. Insurance — in fact, all kinds of insurance, not just health coverage — is exempt from federal antitrust laws, though these protections are more limited than they are for baseball teams. A 1945 law exempts from federal antitrust law the """"business of insurance"""" as long as it is """"regulated by state law."""" However, in some contexts — such as if the conduct involves an agreement to """"boycott, coerce or intimidate"""" — federal antitrust law does apply. This is hardly an arcane issue. As Congress struggles with health care reform legislation, some lawmakers are seeking to lift health insurers' antitrust exemption. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has introduced the Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act, which would, among other things, """"repeal the federal antitrust exemption for health insurance and medical malpractice insurance companies for flagrant antitrust violations, including price-fixing, bid rigging, and market allocations."""" Reps. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., and John Conyers, D-Mich., have introduced an equivalent measure in the House. Both measures are pending. Even though baseball and insurance have somewhat different types of antitrust exemptions, we find they are similar enough to justify the ad's pairing of the two. But when the ad says that baseball and insurance are """"the only industries exempt from antitrust laws,"""" it's wrong. For starters, three additional industries — agricultural cooperatives, fishing cooperatives and maritime shipping — have, like baseball and insurance, what the American Bar Association calls """"general"""" antitrust exemptions. Each of these exemptions stem from a law passed by Congress. For example, they permit co-ops, from milk producers to cranberry growers, to jointly market their products, including setting prices and output. (Congress has also exempted labor unions from antitrust law, but unions aren't an """"industry,"""" so we won't include them in our calculations.) Also, other industries benefit from more limited forms of antitrust exemptions, usually laws that protect specific practices rather than invoking a blanket exemption for business activity. Studies by the ABA and a federal commission counted almost two dozen such partial exemptions. These govern a wide range of activities, including the actions by broadcasters to curb violence in television shows, efforts by airlines to ease airport congestion, attempts by financially troubled newspapers to merge some functions with competitors, and activities by soft drink producers to draw up exclusive sales territories. The Americans United for Change ad is generally correct to equate the antitrust exemptions of baseball and health insurance, but the one for health insurance is more limited. And the ad is incorrect to say that these are the """"only industries exempt from antitrust laws."""" Agricultural and fishing co-ops and maritime shippers have similar exemptions. And a host of other sectors, notably freight rail, have some pretty significant antitrust protections as well.""","http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1290707&type=story, http://books.google.com/books?id=pSG__dm7tYUC&pg=PR3&dq=Capper-Volstead+antitrust+exemption&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=3#v=onepage&q=Capper-Volstead%20antitrust%20exemption&f=false, http://degette.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=833:degette-introduces-bill-to-repeal-antitrust-exemption-for-health-medical-malpractice-insurance-companies&catid=76:press-releases-&Itemid=227, http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/amc/report_recommendation/toc.htm, http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200909/091709a.html, http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/stock-market-news-story.aspx?storyid=200909161613dowjonesdjonline000639&title=house-panel-passes-bill-stripping-rail-antitrust-exemptions, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVHW5JOzv6A, http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=259&page=200",false,"National, Baseball, Health Care, Americans United for Change, "
21378,"""Ron Paul Says Rick Perry wrote a letter """"supporting Hillarycare.""","September 24, 2011","It's correct that Perry sent a letter to Hillary Clinton commending her efforts as the head of the president’s health care task force at a time when the president’s general goals and some possible specifics of the plan had been reported. Yet Perry's letter, dispatched more than five months before the plan was finalized, is clearly a request that the task force consider the interests of rural Americans.",Meghan Ashford-Grooms,"""Standing next to the other Texan seeking the Republican presidential nomination, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Lake Jackson suggested during a Sept. 7, 2011, debate that Gov. Rick Perry had flip-flopped on health care. """"You know, the governor of Texas criticized the governor of Massachusetts for Romneycare, but he wrote a really fancy letter supporting Hillarycare,"""" Paul said, referring to two well-known health care overhaul plans that were debated about a dozen years apart. """"Romneycare"""" is a term that critics use to refer to a 2006 Massachusetts health care law signed by then-Gov. Mitt Romney, who is also currently seeking the Republican presidential nomination. Many Republicans have criticized the law as a government intrusion into the health care system, including through its mandate that residents obtain health coverage. As PolitiFact has noted in previous fact-checks, the Massachusetts law is similar to the act that President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. For this article, we’re reviewing only whether Perry wrote in support of what critics call """"Hillarycare."""" We’re not judging that label. Days after entering office in January 1993, President Bill Clinton created a task force to write health care overhaul legislation to bring costs under control and extend coverage to the nation’s uninsured. He selected his wife, Hillary, to lead it. In September 1993, President Clinton outlined his plan in a speech to Congress, and two months later, legislation was formally introduced by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine. According to a 1994 analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, Clinton’s proposal for universal coverage built on an employer-based health insurance system, requiring individuals to have coverage and employers to provide coverage for their workers and contribute to their premiums. The plan also would have created """"health-purchasing alliances"""" in which private insurers and providers would compete for business from people and businesses. A September 1993 New York Times news article reported that Americans """"would be guaranteed a generous basic package of coverage, negotiated separately in each state by alliances of consumers with insurance companies and medical groups."""" During the Sept. 7 debate, Perry did not dispute that he had written a letter to the first lady in 1993 when he was the Texas agriculture commissioner. """"We were hoping that she would be able to come up with something that would not leave (out) the agriculture men and women — because I was the agriculture commissioner at that particular point in time,"""" Perry said. """"We had no idea it was going to be the monstrosity that's known as Hillarycare."""" Perry’s letter — dated April 6, 1993, and posted online Aug. 30, 2011, by the conservative website Daily Caller — was sent on Texas Department of Agriculture stationery. It opens with Perry saying that he thinks Clinton's """"efforts in trying to reform the nation's health care system are most commendable."""" He continues: """"I would like to request that the task force give particular consideration to the needs of the nation's farmers, ranchers, agriculture workers, and other members of rural communities. Rural populations have a high proportion of uninsured people, rising health care costs, and often experience lack of services."""" Perry then details some of the health care delivery problems in rural areas of Texas, including hospital closures and shortages of providers """"within a safe driving distance."""" The letter continues: """"I have made economic development for rural Texans a high priority in my Administration. Leadership, education, infrastructure systems, and health care facilities can do much towards aiding a rural community to prosper."""" In closing, the letter revisits its opening, stating that Perry thinks Clinton's efforts are """"worthy"""" and asking that she """"remember this constituency as the task force progresses."""" The letter was last brandished against Perry in 2005 when U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison was considering challenging him in the 2006 Republican gubernatorial primary. In a March 2005 news article, though, the Houston Chronicle described Perry’s letter as falling """"far short of actually being an endorsement"""" of the Clinton health care plan. However, the story said, the letter was penned at a time when some commentators were already describing Clinton's idea for a """"government-sponsored HMOs and health care cooperatives as 'socialism.' """" The Chronicle article quotes Perry's 2006 campaign manager, Luis Saenz, as saying that when the letter was written, """"I don't know that anybody knew what the final efforts were going to be."""" In an Aug. 30, 2011, radio interview with Sean Hannity, who also has a Fox News Channel program, Perry said he wrote the letter because he didn't want the Clinton administration """"to overlook a very important constituency."""" Perry said he had no idea that the """"end product"""" would be """"this monstrosity of a bill."""" Fair enough? Not so fast, said Gary Howard, a spokesman for the Paul campaign, who told us in an email that key aspects of the Clinton health care plan were already known before Perry signed the letter to the first lady. He pointed to a news article published in the Los Angeles Times the day before the date of Perry's letter. The April 5, 1993, article says that although many key details of the reform plan remained unsettled, """"the broad outlines"""" were emerging. The story included specifics, including that the plan would likely create new """"government-certified regional health insurance purchasing cooperatives"""" and impose a requirement that employers provide insurance to their workers. We checked to see what Austin American-Statesman readers were learning about the work of the health care task force around the same time. In the second half of March and first week of April 1993, the newspaper published at least 10 news and opinion articles related to the task force or its work, including reports on possible reform ideas and reactions to them. On April 3, 1993, the Statesman published a Los Angeles Times story on its front page noting that the Clinton plan was expected to lead to universal health coverage and a guaranteed set of health benefits for all Americans. The article quoted Ira Magaziner, a leader of the Clinton task force, as saying that care would be delivered under a """"managed competition system,"""" with residents of a geographic area choosing among several health plans that meet government standards. The story also says the Clinton proposal would require businesses to provide health coverage for their employees. Workers could either choose their company's plan or select one offered by """"local buying organizations,"""" which the employer would pay for, according to the article. The next day, the Statesman published another Times article; it details three mechanisms that the task force was reportedly considering to impose price controls on health care services. Our ruling It's correct that Perry sent a letter to Hillary Clinton commending her efforts as the head of the president’s health care task force at a time when the president’s general goals and some possible specifics of the plan had been reported. Yet Perry's letter, dispatched more than five months before the plan was finalized, is clearly a request that the task force consider the interests of rural Americans.""","http://frwebgate1.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/TEXTgate.cgi?WAISdocID=BT5eo7/0/1/0&WAISaction=retrieve, https://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/092411_latpaulbackup.pdf, https://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/092411_latbillintroduced.pdf, http://blog.chron.com/rickperry/2011/08/perry-defends-letter-to-hillary-on-hannity-show-politico-reports/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44S6frKsHtM, http://www.kff.org/uninsured/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&PageID=14731, http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Perry-letter-commending-Hillary-Clinton-found-1914428.php, https://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/092411_howardemail.html, https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/12/tim-pawlenty/pawlenty-says-obamacare-patterned-after-romneycare/, https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/23/us/clinton-s-health-plan-overview-clinton-asks-backing-for-sweeping-change-health.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm, https://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/092411_perrylettertoclinton.doc, http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/7871.pdf, https://dailycaller.com/2011/08/30/rick-perrys-camp-defends-1993-hillarycare-praise/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB7vNniLYcU",false,"Health Care, Texas, Ron Paul, "
26383,"""Facebook post Says President Barack Obama """"signed the medical appliance tax bill that forced companies to outsource manufacturing of masks, gowns, gloves and ventilaors [sic] to China, Europe and Russia to avoid the tax.”""","May 1, 2020","The tax, known as the medical device tax or the medical device excise tax but not the medical appliance tax bill, has not been in effect since the end of  2015. It was repealed in 2019. Experts say the current shortage of personal protective equipment is more likely connected to lack of a reserve stockpile and President Donald Trump’s trade policies, which placed tariffs on imports from China. China is one of the biggest manufacturers of PPE.",Victoria Knight,"""A social media post, which in April was shared widely on Facebook and made appearances on a conservative online discussion forum, asserts that former President Barack Obama signed legislation that caused companies to  manufacture medical devices overseas, including items essential for the current coronavirus pandemic. Alongside a photo of Obama, the text of the Facebook post says: """"Let me be clear. I signed the medical appliance tax bill that forced companies to outsource manufacturing of masks, gowns, gloves and ventilaors [sic] to China, Europe and Russia to avoid the tax."""" The image piqued our interest because it combined a few hot-button issues. First, the concern that the U.S. is experiencing a shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment, or PPE, like masks, gowns and gloves to help protect front-line workers from coronavirus. Second, issues related to trade imbalances and the outsourcing of American manufacturing abroad are likely to be frequent themes on the presidential campaign trail. So we decided to dig in. Though the image did not include sourcing or sponsorship information, its target — the """"medical appliance tax bill"""" — seemed to be a reference to the medical device tax (more formally known as the medical device excise tax) that became law as part of the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, much of the social media post tracked closely to  statements made by conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh during an April 2 episode of his talk show, which included a discussion of the medical device tax. Before we get into the specifics of the medical device tax, two critical elements of the post must be addressed. First, did Obama ever say anything like what the viral image claims? We checked with Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to the former president. In an email he wrote back: """"President Obama obviously didn’t say this!"""" A key piece of evidence that supports Schultz’s statement is the use of the term """"medical appliance device tax bill."""" Bottom line: We couldn’t find any other reference — either official or unofficial — to a piece of federal legislation bearing this name or nickname. And, though the experts we spoke with agreed the social media post was likely directed at the device tax included in the ACA, none had ever heard it referred to with that moniker — a point that adds more skepticism to the image’s claim. In order to pay for the ACA’s expansion of health coverage, taxes were increased for various industries — including the medical device industry — that would benefit from more people getting health insurance. The tax was controversial and triggered considerable pushback. The measure set a 2.3% excise tax on medical devices, sold in the United States beginning in January 2013. The tax applied to both domestic manufacturers and importers of medical devices. But, it did not apply to items made in the U.S. for foreign export, said John McDonough, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who also served as a senior adviser during the Obama administration and helped write the Affordable Care Act. """"The tax was designed deliberately"""" to avoid forcing manufacturers to move their production overseas, McDonough wrote in an email. Opponents of the tax argued that it was a severe financial burden on medical device manufacturers. They also estimated that it would have resulted in the loss of more than 20,000 full-time domestic jobs in the industry. Joseph Antos, a health policy scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, said that the tax was punishing on the medical device industry because it was implemented on """"gross sales rather than profits,"""" which raised issues for small device firms. However, a 2015 Congressional Research Service report said that the medical device tax seemed to have only """"fairly minor effects"""" on jobs with """"output and employment in the industry falling by no more than two-tenths of 1%."""" Antos said that though the tax """"clearly"""" had an effect on the industry, he wasn't aware of any studies or statistics that showed production and sales moving overseas because of it. But Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow and expert in health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, took an even harder line on the social media image’s assertion. """"It’s absolutely false on the face of it,"""" he said. """"There was no way the tax provided any incentive to shift production overseas."""" Van de Water also said that while there was some shift of manufacturing overseas while the tax was in effect, there were other factors leading that push, such as competition and pressure to reduce costs. """"There’s no way to attribute that to the device tax itself,"""" he added. And, there’s another complication. Congress acted to put the medical device tax on hold at the end of 2015 -- in part due to significant lobbying by the medical device industry, as well as opposition to it from both Republican and Democratic members of Congress who had medical device companies headquartered in their states. In December 2019, President Donald Trump permanently repealed the tax when he signed a bipartisan federal spending package. """"The tax was only in effect for three years, from 2013 to 2015,"""" said Van de Water. """"Even if it [the medical device tax] had some effect, that effect would have ended in 2016. We’re now four years later."""" So finally, does the now non-existent medical device tax have anything to do with our current PPE shortage in the face of the coronavirus pandemic? The answer to that is also no, said the experts. The current personal protective equipment shortage can be attributed to the lack of a stockpile reserve of PPE, an initial slow response by the U.S. and the tariffs imposed against Chinese goods by the Trump administration, said Peter Petri, a professor of international finance at Brandeis University outside Boston. AEI’s Antos considered it an issue of the huge demand for these items, which has made replenishing stockpiles more difficult. According to a recent report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in 2018 China was the source of 48% of U.S. imports of PPE. Seventy percent of the United States’ mouth and nose protective gear, such as masks, came from China in 2018. Overall, China is a major supplier of PPE to countries all over the world. Petri said this makes sense, since China is a low-cost manufacturer of these relatively simple products. But it also became a problem once the White House started implementing tariffs on Chinese products. """"For nearly a year, U.S. buyers have been moving their PPE business away from China to other countries because of the Trump tariff wall,"""" Petri wrote in an email. But those manufacturers in other countries were not able to scale up their production to make up for the amount of supplies needed when the coronavirus hit. """"Meanwhile Chinese suppliers were turning to markets in Europe. The U.S. could not have chosen a worse time to turn its back on the world's largest PPE producer,"""" said Petri. China’s massive manufacturing capacity did allow it to scale up production to account for the coronavirus pandemic, but because it had already established businesses in other locales and in response to the imposed tariffs, Petri suggested, it is unlikely now that China would be as receptive to U.S. requests for PPE. Nothing in this viral image is accurate. There is even a spelling error. Obama did not sign anything into law called the """"medical appliance tax bill."""" A moratorium was placed on the medical device tax he did sign into law as part of the Affordable Care Act in late 2015.

22684,Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse.,"January 31, 2011",President Obama says veterans can now access their electronic medical records online,Robert Farley,"""State of the Union addresses often seem interminably long. But with so much ground to cover and so many members of the public tuned in -- not to mention intense media scrutiny -- economic use of words is crucial. And so, after interest groups hear what's in the speech for them, they are often left to parse the meaning and import of just a few sentences. There is often a balancing act between brevity and full accuracy. We'll deal with just such a conflict here. In his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama boasted that his administration has made """"great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste."""" And he used the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs as a prime example. """"Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse,"""" Obama said. Two days later, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) posted a response on their website accusing Obama of """"mischaracterizing"""" the VA electronic medical records system. """"This is not true,"""" stated IAVA Founder and Executive Director Paul Rieckhoff. """"Contrary to the president’s comment, the only thing a veteran can download from the VA’s system are pharmaceutical records and personal health information that he or she has self-entered. This is a critical distinction. """"The president’s comments are misleading to service members, veterans and the American public, who now think that this system is in place and functional, while it is clearly not. In the last 24 hours, IAVA has heard from hundreds of members, who have expressed surprise and outrage that the president could get something so wrong in arguably the most important speech of the year."""" In October, the administration formally launched something called the """"VA Blue Button"""" which allows veterans to download and view some medical information online. Primarily, it allows veterans to access self-entered health metrics such as blood pressure, weight and heart rate as well as emergency contact information, test results, family health history, military health history and other health-related information. Using data from the patient’s Veterans Health Administration’s Electronic Health Records (VistA), it also allows vets to access information about their VA prescription histories, wellness reminders and VA appointments (both past and future). Can a vet get all of his or her medical records via the Blue Button? No. You still can't yet get medical records such as doctors' notes or X-rays. But more and more medical information will become available via the Blue Button over time, said Peter L. Levin, chief technology officer at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the co-creator of the Blue Button. """"The things they can download today are generally the kinds of things you'd fill in on a clipboard when you go to see a specialist,"""" Levin said. In March, the VA plans to add information on allergies, he said. And soon, the Blue Button will offer access to lab results, including chemistry and hematology. """"We are on a steady path, capturing more and more information from VistA and putting it into MyHealthyVet,"""" Levin said. And vets' requests will drive the information that will be added in the future, he said. """"This is actually a monumental VA initiative,"""" said Paul Sullivan, executive director of Veterans for Common Sense. """"You have to give the VA some credit."""" Perhaps, he said, President Obama should have said medical """"information"""" rather than """"medical records"""" are now available to vets online, because the phrase implies things like doctors' notes and medical test results are online. """"Maybe he didn't get it exactly right,"""" Sullivan said. """"It could come down to word choice. Some of your medical records are online. Some, but not all."""" Joe Davis, a spokesman for Veterans of Foreign Wars, also praised the VA's Blue Button as a """"unique"""" feature that puts the VA out front on technology. But when Obama said, """"Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse,"""" was he accurate? """"Yes, kinda, sorta,"""" Davis said. """"They can download a part. 'Some' would have been more accurate. It all depends on your interpretation."""" Davis also said the VFW hasn't gotten any calls from veterans confused by the president's statement. Probably, he said, most realize that in a State of the Union address, every word takes up time, and so the president used a bit of short-hand. In rating this comment, we weighed the fact that many veterans groups have praised the Blue Button as a major step forward. The medical information now available to veterans is an undeniably valuable technological tool and a praiseworthy advance. But Obama's claim that vets """"can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse"""" suggests much more availability than exists. One could reasonably assume he meant a vet could access all of his or her medical records online. In fact, most of the information now available to vets is information they self-entered. Vets can't yet get a lot of medical records though the Blue Button (though more and more information is being added in the near future).""","http://www.va.gov/bluebutton/, https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/10/07/blue-button-provides-access-downloadable-personal-health-data, http://iava.org/blog/state-union-mischaracterizes-va-electronic-medical-records-system, https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/25/remarks-president-state-union-address",false,"National, Health Care, Technology, Veterans, Barack Obama, "

Last week we brought you example No. 1. Example No. 2 is as follows: Several conspiracy websites have raised questions lately about a """"bioweapons lab"""" in Sierra Leone being the source of the virus. Questions like, """"What's behind the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone? Could it possibly be a U.S. bioweapons project gone amuck?"""" Some of the websites tie the """"bioweapons lab"""" to billionaires George Soros and Bill and Melinda Gates. """"At the epicentre of the current Ebola epidemic is the Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone, which houses a U.S. a (sic) biosecurity level 2 bioweapons research lab with links to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Soros Foundation,"""" reads an excerpt shared on sites like RumorMillsNews.com and BeforeItsNews.com. We wanted to set the record straight. Soros and Gates There’s no proof of Soros and Gates funding a bioweapons lab in Kenema, one of the largest cities in Sierra Leone with a population of about 150,000. And there’s really no case that a bioweapons lab in Kenema is behind the outbreak. """"The assertion is absurd,"""" said Chris Williams, spokesman for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Gates Foundation did provide a $1 million Ebola-related grant to support emergency efforts in West Africa by UNICEF, he said. A spokeswoman for Soros’ Open Society Foundations also said it does not fund any labs, much less a bioweapons lab, in West Africa. We can’t exactly pinpoint the reason people are connecting Soros and the Gateses to the Ebola outbreak, our best guess is people are trying to insinuate they had something to do with creating the current crisis. One blogger who invoked the Soros/Gates connection, Dublinsmick, referenced the website of the """"viral fever bioweapons lab inside Kenema Government Hospital,"""" saying it """"read like a roll call of New World Order organizations."""" The New World Order is a popular conspiracy theory whereby a group of wealthy elites plan to take over the world. Here’s the list, which does not include Soros or Gates: The Consortium is a collaboration between Tulane, Scripps Research Institute, Broad Institute, Harvard University, University of California at San Diego, University of Texas Medical Branch, Autoimmune Technologies LLC, Corgenix Medical Corporation, Kenema Government Hospital (Sierra Leone), Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (Nigeria) and various other partners in West Africa. …The Consortium intends to expand this program to include other important infectious agents such as Ebola, Marburg and other Arenaviruses that are of great concern to public health and bioterrorism,"""" states the bioweapons lab website. This text matches a list of partners of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium, which conducts research at Kenema. No, it does not describe itself as a bioweapons lab. And the program director said there is no financial connection to Gates or Soros. We did find one very, very loose Soros-Gates link. One of the Broad Institute researchers who is part of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium is a Harvard University computational geneticist who earned her medical degree from Harvard Medical School as a Soros Fellow, and her work is supported by awards from groups that include the Gates Foundation. Of course, she was also a Rhodes scholar, won a Packard Foundation award in science and engineering, and was recognized by the National Institutes of Health with an Innovator Award. A spokeswoman for the Broad Institute, Haley Bridger, said the institute has not received money from Soros. She said it has received money from the Gates Foundation, but it was for research on tuberculosis, not Ebola. The consortium Before the current Ebola outbreak, members of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium focused their work on a bigger concern in West Africa: Lassa fever, a viral disease with symptoms that resemble Ebola but is more common than Ebola in that area. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases awarded a five-year, $15 million contract to Tulane to continue researching Lassa fever, and the consortium was created in 2010. Tulane University researchers have worked in the area for about a decade to better understand Lassa fever and develop modern diagnostic assays, or tests to see if a person has the fever, and treatments. Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone is a major partner of the research scientists from Tulane and other universities. The multi-facility hospital contains a laboratory and ward dedicated to Lassa fever research and isolating Lassa fever patients. When the first Ebola case was diagnosed in Guinea, about three hours from the Kenema site in in early 2014, a team from the consortium went to Kenema to help the site switch gears. """"We were there working 10 years and then Ebola came here,"""" said Dr. Robert Garry, a Tulane University professor and program manager of the consortium. """"We’re not here to turn Lassa and Ebola into a kind of superweapon. It can do that on its own."""" The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases also sometimes works in the facility, Garry said. Part of its mission is to prevent viruses like Ebola and Lassa fever from being used deliberately as bioterrorism agents against soldiers and civilians. It did not respond to our inquiry by our deadline. Ebola infections have cropped up over the years, but the latest spell is the deadliest, with 961 deaths and 1,779 infections reported by the World Health Organization. The first case was reported in Gueckedou, Guinea, in early 2014 before it spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria, some of the poorest parts of Africa with limited access to medical care (and in some cases, a deep mistrust among some residents of medical professionals spreading the disease). So, no, it did not start at the country-owned hospital in Kenema, though the city is a major player in a very dispersed outbreak. The hospital’s medical staff is in the thick of treating patients infected with the Ebola virus, and several nurses and doctors have died in the course of treating patients. That includes Dr. Sheik Umar Kahn, a worldwide pioneer of Ebola research from Sierra Leone who died July 28. Kahn was the physician in charge of the Lassa Fever Program at the Kenema hospital, so he worked with researchers from Tulane and elsewhere. """"The conspiracy theories really just kind of, wow,"""" Garry said. """"Our teammates are dying, and you’re talking this trash about us.""""

Rick Scott has with the nation’s health care law. He says it will lead to increased premiums. How? Through the part of the law that creates an online marketplace for individuals who do not receive insurance from their employers. Known as a health exchange, the idea is consumers can compare plans to get the best deal. After the Supreme Court upheld the law, Scott announced he would not to set up the required exchanges, which means the federal government will step in to do it. Scott -- who built his fortune running the nation’s largest hospital chain and his political cred leading an attack group opposed to health reforms -- says these exchanges """"don’t work"""" and will lead to bigger bills for families. """"If it was such a great idea the private sector would do it,"""" Scott said on Fox News on July 2. """"And we know the Congressional Budget Office said if you’re going to buy your own policy with these exchanges you’ll be paying 10 percent more, or a family will. So about $2,100 more for a family. So you’re going to pay more with these exchanges."""" We’re familiar with Scott’s comments, which have roots in this 2009 report from the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan research agency. Origins of this talking point  The CBO report, produced Nov. 30, 2009, examined how the law would affect health care premiums for people who purchase insurance through an employer-based group market (both large and small businesses) and for individuals. As Scott said, CBO expected the average premium per person in new individual policies would rise 10 percent to 13 percent in 2016 compared with where it was before the law took effect. In this market, average premiums per policy in this market would be about $5,800 for single policies (a $300 increase) and $15,200 for families (a $2,100 increase -- just like Scott said), according to CBO (pages 5 and 6). If only the report ended there. Subsidies and expanded coverage  More than half the 32 million people expected to seek their own coverage in 2016 (57 percent) would be eligible for subsidies that would reduce their premiums by 50 to 60 percent, the CBO said. (The subsidies are to be allocated according to a fee schedule that links a person’s income with the federal poverty level.) Scott’s comments also don’t account for an important change with these individual policies. People will pay more, but it will be for a bigger swath of benefits. The law requires insurance companies to offer an """"essential health benefits"""" package that would mirror benefits people get through employer plans. These new policies have to cover services such as maternity care, prescription drugs, and treatment for mental and substance abuse. In an """"apples to apples"""" comparison, CBO found that premiums for new """"essential health benefits"""" packages would actually be 7 to 10 percent less than equivalent insurance under the old law. A small market  Scott was specific when he described who would be affected by CBO’s projections. But he didn’t include an important qualifier: People purchasing their own health insurance comprise less than one-fifth of the market. According to CBO, people in the individual market could make up about 17 percent of the insurance market in 2016. The biggest share, about 70 percent of the market, belongs to people who receive coverage in the large-group market. Health insurance premiums for the 134 million people in this larger, employer-based classification could decrease by zero to 3 percent in 2016. As for the small group market, which is comprised of businesses with 50 or fewer workers, their premiums would stay mostly the same, either increasing 1 percent or dropping 2 percent. Our ruling Scott said that the Congressional Budget Office said people would pay 10 percent more for policies on the exchange, """"so about $2,100 more for a family."""" What he doesn’t say is that these policies will have to offer comprehensive coverage. So people will pay more, but they’re also get more benefits.

24482,"""Forty-five percent of doctors """"say they'll quit"""" if health care reform passes.""","October 15, 2009",Beck says 45 percent of physicians would quit if health reform passes,Louis Jacobson,"""Physicians are important players in the health care debate. They've been courted by both supporters and opponents of the Democratic reform plan. President Barack Obama held a Rose Garden ceremony with some of them recently. And now opponents of the Democratic health care plan are citing poll results that supposedly show that lots of doctors would be so unhappy with the reforms that they'd quit their jobs. Fox News Channel political commentator Glenn Beck mentioned this on his Oct. 12, 2009, show during a wide-ranging critique of the Democratic plan. He said that the plan could harm doctors financially and make medical students have doubts about pursuing the profession. """"Do you really think that you're going to see an increase in medical students? I don't think so,"""" Beck said. """"Especially consider that the percentage of doctors who say they'll quit if this is passed is only 45 percent. No worries. Ha! You'll be able to find a good doctor. Really, you will."""" If true, the sudden departure of 45 percent of the nation's doctors would indeed constitute a stinging rejection of the Democratic effort by an influential health care constituency. But that number sounded high to us, so we decided to look into the statistic's origins. It came from a survey of """"practicing physicians"""" published in mid September. The survey was sponsored by the newspaper  Investor's Business Daily  and was done by the firm TechnoMetrica Institute of Policy and Politics, or TIPP. The survey was conducted between Aug. 28, 2009, and Sept. 15, 2009. It was mailed to 25,600 physicians nationwide at addresses purchased from a list broker. We found several problems with the poll and the way Beck described its results:  •  Beck misstated what the poll asked  . Beck said that 45 percent of doctors will quit. But in fact, the poll found that 45 percent of doctors said they will consider quitting. Considering quitting isn't the same thing as quitting, which makes Beck's statement a significant exaggeration. In addition, the specific question asked of respondents was, """"If Congress passes their health care plan, will you ... continue your practice, [or] consider leaving your practice or taking an early retirement?"""" This wording leaves open the possibility that respondents are saying they might simply leave their current practice to join another practice, rather than quit. • The poll had a low response rate  . According to the statistics published in  IBD  , 1,376 practicing physicians responded to the poll, out of the 25,600 solicited nationally. That's a 5.4 percent response rate. In one of its articles about the poll,  IBD  bills this as """"a high rate of return, considering how difficult doctors are to get hold of."""" But another survey of doctors released around the same time managed to do better — much better. That other survey was conducted by Salomeh Keyhani and Alex Federman, internists and researchers at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, who published the results in the  New England Journal of Medicine  . They mailed 5,157 questionnaires and got a response rate that exceeded 43 percent — nearly eight times the  IBD  survey's rate. In fact, Keyhani and Federman reached almost 50 percent more doctors despite sending out only one-fifth the number of inquiries. (They did not ask doctors if they would consider quitting as the other poll did.) Does a higher response rate matter? In this case, it's hard to know for sure, said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. However, she added, """"higher response rates give me more confidence in results,"""" a point echoed by other experts we interviewed. • The sponsor was listed prominently on the survey, possibly influencing who responded  . The survey was sent out on  Investor’s Business Daily  letterhead, and the introduction said in part, """"The results of this survey will be on  Investor’s Business Daily’s  front page and investors.com. A press release will also be prepared. This will give doctors a voice in this key issue."""" This type of framing matters because  IBD  's editorial page is known for its conservative stance, including opposition to the Democratic health care effort. While it’s safe to assume that not everyone who received the survey knew about  IBD  's political leanings, some respondents presumably did — and among those who did, such knowledge could have made a difference in determining who responded. Liberals might have been less likely to respond, while conservatives in tune with the  IBD  editorials would have been more enthusiastic about responding. In such a small sample, even a modest bias of that sort could skew the results. • The wording of questions may have influenced who responded  . In an interview, Mark Blumenthal, who blogs at pollster.com and has written critically of the  IBD  poll, said the wording of the questions could have skewed the results. He noted that, unlike telephone polls, mail polls enable the recipient to skim the entire list of questions before deciding to answer any of them. With the  IBD  poll, respondents might have thought some of the questions had a subtext that was critical of the Democratic proposal. One was, """"Do you believe the government can cover 47 million more people and it will cost less money and the quality of care will be better?"""" Another was, """"If Congress passes their plan, do you expect fewer students to apply to med schools in the future [or] more students to apply to med schools in the future?"""" A third was, """"Under a government plan, do you think drug companies will have incentives to continue developing as many life saving new drugs?"""" (Grammatical errors in original;  full survey text available here.) """"Collectively, these questions imply that health care reform will mean very bad things for medicine,"""" Blumenthal said. """"I'm guessing that a proreform doctor would be inclined to ignore, and not return, a survey if the questions seem leading or biased."""" Could the prominence of the  IBD  name and the question wording have made a difference? The evidence suggests that may be true. In the  IBD  poll, 65 percent of the doctors who responded said they opposed """"government's proposed health care plan"""" while just 33 percent supported it. By contrast, the Keyhani-Federman poll found that 63 percent of doctors surveyed favored giving patients a choice between public and private insurance, as congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama have advocated. Another 10 percent said they favored a single-payer health care system — a solution that is actually to the left of the president. In other words, the results of the two polls are so far apart that they are essentially opposites. The truth may actually lie somewhere in between the two surveys. It's worth noting that the Keyhani-Federman poll received financial support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which favors health care reform. Also, National Public Radio has said that """"Keyhani and Federman belong to ... the National Physicians Alliance. It supports a public option, and Keyhani has spoken publicly about her own support for a public option."""" A campaign finance database search found that both researchers donated to the Obama campaign in 2008 — $500 from Keyhani and $300 from Federman. In addition, the initial postcard Keyhani and Federman sent to doctors included the subheading, """"Congress wants to hear from doctors on health care reform"""" — advocacy-style language similar to what the  IBD  poll said. This may have produced some ideological bias in the opposite direction from  IBD  's poll. (In an interview, Federman said the reason for choosing the words they did stemmed from """"what the literature shows about what works to get docs to respond to surveys."""") Finally, Don Dillman, an expert in mail-based polls and a professor at Washington State University, suggests another factor that could make the  IBD  poll results on doctors quitting vastly overstated: People don't usually make decisions about changing careers lightly. """"If one is trained to be a physician, then are you going to take on another occupation?"""" he asks. This concern is especially relevant for younger physicians, who would likely find few new careers that would earn them enough income to pay off their debts from attending medical school. So, back to Beck's statement. First, he misstated the results of the poll. The survey didn't say 45 percent would quit; it said they would consider quitting, which is considerably different. Moreover, polling experts have raised significant questions about the poll's methodology. Of special concern are the combination of the heavy mention of  IBD  's name and questions that experts said appeared to be seeking answers critical of health reform. We'd like to see an independent poll assessing doctors' views of health care reform, but neither the findings from the  IBD  survey nor those from the Keyhani-Federman study are fully persuasive to us.""","http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112818960, http://fundrace.huffingtonpost.com/neighbors.php?type=name&lname=Federman, http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/361/14/e24, https://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/09/ibdtipp-doctors-poll-is-not-trustworthy.html, http://fundrace.huffingtonpost.com/neighbors.php?type=name&lname=Keyhani&fname=Salomeh, http://www.pollster.com/blogs/a_tale_of_two_doctor_polls.php, http://www.nationaljournal.com/njonline/mp_20090918_4062.php, http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/SpecialReport.aspx?id=506106, http://www.glennbeck.com/content/articles/article/198/31795/",false,"National, Health Care, Pundits, Glenn Beck, "

Texas Medicaid payment rates indeed trail those for other kinds of insurance. But the crux of this statement, the 7-in-10 statistic, lacks factual footing partly because it combines different answers to an outdated Texas physician survey. In contrast, a 2016 national survey indicated about 2 in 10 U.S. physicians were not accepting Medicaid patients with about 6 in 10 accepting them. The same year, a survey found about four in 10 Texas doctors weren't accepting new Medicaid patients. It's worth noting, still, a 2017 study suggesting far more Texas specialists weren't accepting new Medicaid patients.""",W. Gardner Selby,"""In a March 2017 email blast, a Texas state senator who's a physician said that in a meeting with President Donald Trump, she’d promoted federal block grants as a way to give states more sway over the costs of Medicaid, the decades-old federal-state insurance program for the poor and disabled. Donna Campbell, R-New Braunfels, then declared: """"Seven out of ten doctors are not taking any new Medicaid patients as lower reimbursement rates make it cost-prohibitive."""" Really? Let’s gauge physician acceptance of Medicaid patients, then the program's payments. A Senate aide to Campbell, Curtis Buckley, said by email that Campbell based her 7-out-of-10 statistic on a 2012 Texas Medical Association survey indicating 44 percent of doctors were declining new Medicaid patients, 26 percent limited such patients and 31 percent accepted new Medicaid patients without restriction. Indeed, in 2013, we found a claim tied to that survey that 31 percent of Texas physicians were accepting all new Medicaid patients. Those figures, we noted, were based on poll responses rather than hard numbers. There's fresher data. The group's 2016 survey, which we fielded from TMA spokesman Steve Levine, found 38 percent of physicans accepting no new Medicaid patients, 21 percent limiting such patients and 41 percent accepting new Medicaid patients without restriction. Both surveys, that is, indicated about four in 10 Texas practices not accepting new Medicaid patients. Levine, asked why the association surveys suggest some inching up in the share of Texas physicians accepting all Medicaid patients, said a factor was a provision in the 2010 Obamacare law that temporarily raised Medicaid rates paid for services by certain physicians. Buckley, Campbell’s aide, also pointed out a 2014 study by Merritt Hawkins, a Dallas-based health-focused consulting firm, testing Medicaid acceptance rates in Dallas and Houston. His nudge led us to find another Merritt Hawkins study, were released just before Campbell made her claim. It indicates that nationally as of early 2017, 53 percent of 1,414 contacted physician practices in major metro areas were accepting Medicaid insurance with 60 percent of 494 practices in mid-sized metro areas doing so. Acceptance rates were lower, though, in cities where different kinds of practices (cardiology, dermatology, obstetrics-gynecology, orthopedic surgery and family medicine) were queried by phone in January-February 2017. On average, 17 percent of Dallas practices, 26 percent of Odessa practices and 37 percent of Houston practices, respectively, reported accepting new Medicaid patients. The 2017 report said: """"The rate at which physicians accept Medicaid can vary for a number of reasons. In some cases, reimbursement rates provided by Medicaid to particular specialists may be below their cost of providing services. If not actually below costs, Medicaid reimbursement often is relatively low compared to that offered by other payers, and busy physicians may have no economic incentive to see Medicaid patients. In other cases, the process of billing for and receiving Medicaid payment can be problematic and some physicians choose to avoid it."""" A Merritt Hawkins spokesman, Phil Miller, pointed us to yet another report, though its focus wasn't on acceptance of """"new"""" Medicaid patients. The 2016 national survey of 17,200 physicians conducted by the company for the Physicians Foundation, which says it seeks to empower physicians to lead in the delivery of high-quality, cost-efficient healthcare, found 16 percent not seeing Medicaid patients, 20 percent limiting such patients and 64 percent accepting Medicaid patients. A chart based on the survey showed variations among states -- and that nearly 30 percent of Texas physicians did not accept Medicaid patients. State data Next, we asked the Texas Health and Human Services Commission for data on Texas physicians and Medicaid patients. By email, Christine Mann sent a spreadsheet indicating that in fiscal 2016, which ran through August 2016, 63,915 Texas physicians were enrolled in Medicaid, including 31,585 primary-care doctors. The sheet further says that as of September 2016, per the Texas Medical Board, 74,098 physicians were licensed to practice in Texas. So, about 85 percent of the state’s physicians had a connection to Medicaid, though Levine separately said that could overly represent doctors who only occasionally treat Medicaid patients in emergency rooms and in unusual circumstances. But the commission’s data showed that only 32,130 Texas physicians reported a paid Medicaid claim in fiscal 2016. Those doctors amounted to about 43 percent of physicians licensed to practice in the state. Yet there’s a twist to that too, Miller helped us recognize: Data tracked by the Texas Department of State Health Services shows that in 2016, the state had 50,948 """"direct patient care physicians,"""" meaning doctors who worked directly with patients as opposed to those who were researchers, administrators or teachers. If you assume direct-care doctors predominantly submitted the tallied paid claims, then you can hypothesize that 63 percent of active physicians had a paid Medicaid claim. Levine commented: """"Still–having one Medicaid claim paid is not nearly the same as taking new (let alone all new) Medicaid patients."""" Other analyses For broader perspective, we turned to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which focuses on national health issues and said in a March 2017 web post that nationally, about 70 percent of office-based physicians accept new Medicaid patients. That figure is a little old; it traces to a 2015 study based on the 2013 National Electronic Health Records Survey, a nationally representative survey that collects information on physician and practice characteristics. According to the results, 68.9 percent of U.S. office-based physicians who accepted any new patients were accepting new Medicaid patients--with 57.6 percent of such Texas physicians doing so:          We sought more recent data and Jeff Lancashire of the National Center for Health Statistics emailed us an excerpt from the 2015 NEHRS survey indicating 28.2 percent of primary-care physicians weren't accepting new Medicaid patients with 71.6 percent accepting such patients--with Texas-specific results yet to be posted, the center's Corey Slavitt told us. After Campbell made her statement, FactCheck.org, a fact-checking effort based at the University of Pennsylvania, posted a lengthy analysis of flaws in claims about low physician participation in Medicaid. """"There are no continuous measures on Medicaid participation,"""" that story says, """"but federal statistics gathered over recent years show that the percentage of physicians accepting new Medicaid patients has remained around 70 percent,"""" though the story says participation rates have been affected by differences in state-specific reimbursement rates. Medicaid fees Campbell’s aide, Buckley, said her reference to lower Medicaid fees tied to her professional background and her understanding that Medicaid fees have long been a factor in doctors not accepting or limiting new Medicaid patients. Buckley also pointed out a June 2016 analysis published by the TMA confirming that in Texas, """"reimbursement amounts for the same procedures differ among payers, with public payers (Medicare and Medicaid) setting a much lower rate than"""" what private payers offer. Our hunt for expertise led us to Stephen Zuckerman, co-director of the Health Policy Center at the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Institute, which has surveyed state-set Medicaid fees since 1993. On March 5, 2017, the institute posted a report co-authored by Zuckerman indicating that in July 2016, Medicaid fees paid Texas physicians amounted, on average, to 65 percent of fees paid in the state by federally funded Medicare; nationally, Medicaid fees averaged 72 percent of Medicare fees. In Texas, the report says, Medicaid fees paid for primary care services in 2016 were 58 percent of Medicare fees; for obstetric services, 66 percent; and for other services, 85 percent. A chart in the report indicates 2016 Medicaid fees paid Texas physicians were up slightly, 0.2 percent, from 2014 and those fees amounted to 88 percent of average Medicaid fees paid nationally. By phone, Zuckerman said Medicaid’s relatively lower fees definitely influence some physician decisions to accept patients. Zuckerman said doctors also cite the hassles of signing up for Medicaid and submitting claims. Another expert, the Kaiser foundation’s Julia Paradise, said by phone that Medicaid fees and physician participation comprise part of the story. A broader issue, she said, is whether Medicaid beneficiaries have access to providers. In that vein, Zuckerman pointed out a University of Pennsylvania study published in March 2017 finding that in 2016, appointments could be scheduled by phone by Texas Medicaid patients with about 60 percent of primary-care physicians--an insignificant change from 2013, the researchers wrote. Texas private-pay patients were able to schedule appointments with more than 80 percent of primary-care physicians, the researchers found. Our ruling Campbell said: """"Seven out of ten doctors are not taking any new Medicaid patients as lower reimbursement rates make it cost-prohibitive."""" Texas Medicaid payment rates indeed trail those for other kinds of insurance. But the crux of this statement, the 7-in-10 statistic, lacks factual footing partly because it combines different answers to an outdated Texas physician survey. In contrast, a 2016 national survey indicated about 2 in 10 U.S. physicians were not accepting Medicaid patients with about 6 in 10 accepting them. The same year, a survey found about four in 10 Texas doctors weren't accepting new Medicaid patients. It's worth noting, still, a 2017 study suggesting far more Texas specialists weren't accepting new Medicaid patients. – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""","http://kff.org/person/julia-paradise/, http://www.urban.org/research/publication/medicaid-physician-fees-after-aca-primary-care-fee-bump/view/full_report, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MSAsA2am_G6Nlju0GLQ0M0bVK8H0LR4Or6dNiUJYuu4/pub, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ai4kTmngpFNjA2Fsd77UWhFrfDNuaQThVnpkObQkqmI/pub, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AJc5bdXjLUJxw1i8skWTQGTnsmyKcoWHnk1NxdZzb6g/pub, https://docs.google.com/document/d/107r7HsJ9HnThAwO2cBFPu9o-Bk32GCQG3B-aqbOaGa4/edit?usp=sharing, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Crgh9EsKrTyLEw43_taoV-pHdWO9k-e6qJyNXjnVoi0/pub, https://www.merritthawkins.com/uploadedFiles/MerrittHawkins/Pdf/mha2017waittimesurveyPDF.pdf, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l-ydepytMfJUOySUiCoa2DtZNjhFV0OcrvfrrhC44XA/edit?usp=sharing, http://www.urban.org/author/stephen-zuckerman, https://www.factcheck.org/2017/03/medicaids-doctor-participation-rates/, https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=201110&RIN=0938-AQ63#, https://bit.ly/2nG0LBR, http://ldi.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/Appointment%20Availability%20Post%20ACA.pdf, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhrMRtCYGt1DsSTjdbWhyf9oh_lHacfHJeEUiQVubN8/pub, https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGNzFqSG9obWhTcU0/view?usp=sharing, https://bit.ly/2nZJRPa, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aH8EE-vwonIWUDfWxbC7-O4Y69QhbeQVB_k7jZ8NJP8/edit?usp=sharing, http://www.physiciansfoundation.org/uploads/default/Biennial_Physician_Survey_2016.pdf",false,"Health Care, Medicaid, Texas, Donna Campbell, "

Meanwhile, Donald Trump has linked childhood vaccines to autism despite the medical community debunking that myth. During the second GOP debate, Tapper asked Ben Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon who now lives in West Palm Beach, if Trump should stop making such a claim. Carson said Trump should look at the evidence, noting that there is """"extremely well-documented proof that there’s no autism associated with vaccinations."""" Carson then turned the subject to the scheduling of vaccines: """"But it is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time. And a lot of pediatricians now recognize that, and I think are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done, and I think that’s appropriate."""" Are pediatricians cutting down on the number and proximity of vaccines? As for Trump’s claim about autism, as PolitiFact has noted before, decades of epidemiological research have demonstrated autism rates do not increase when vaccines are introduced to a population. We contacted Carson’s campaign to ask for his evidence and did not get a reply. Vaccines Doctors follow a childhood vaccination schedule prepared by the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Children may receive as many as 24 immunizations by their second birthday and may receive up to five injections during a single doctor’s visit, according to a 2013 paper by The Institute of Medicines of the National Academies. That vaccine schedule is also supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control. More than 90 percent of children entering kindergarten have been immunized with recommended vaccines in accordance with this schedule. But some parents have sought to delay vaccines or reduce the number given per visit, while others have rejected them entirely, despite recommendations by the scientific community. That’s not a good idea, according to the report. """"Delaying or declining vaccination has led to outbreaks of such vaccine-preventable diseases as measles and whooping cough that may jeopardize public health, particularly for people who are under-immunized or who were never immunized,"""" wrote researchers. The researchers also concluded that there is """"no evidence that the schedule is unsafe."""" The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a press release in 2013 stating that it agreed with the paper’s conclusion. After the Republican debate, it issued a new statement in support of vaccines: """"Claims that vaccines are linked to autism, or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule, have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature. It is dangerous to public health to suggest otherwise,"""" wrote Karen Remley, executive director of the academy. Despite the scientific consensus, pediatricians are facing pressure from parents to delay vaccines. A survey of 534 pediatricians done for the American Academy of Pediatricians in 2012 showed that 93 percent reported that within a typical month some parents asked to spread out the vaccinations. The vast majority thought these parents were putting their children at risk for disease but thought they would build trust with the families if they agreed to the request. While there is anecdotal evidence that some pediatricians have acquiesced to parents’ requests to delay vaccinations, that decision is not rooted in public health or science. """"There is no evidence that pediatricians 'recognize' that we give too many vaccines in too short a time,"""" said Mark Schleiss, division director of pediatric infectious diseases at University of Minnesota. """"Far from it. ... There is no evidence at all that spacing vaccines out or changing the schedule would improve health or help children."""" Eugene R. Hershorin, chief of the division of general pediatrics at the University of Miami, pointed to what happened a decade ago when England and Japan delayed the DTaP vaccine, a combination vaccine used to prevent diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.

However, just about every other sentence of his remarks was filled with caveats indicating that the situation could change. He did not suggest that there was “nothing to worry about” or that the virus “posed no threat to the public.”",Louis Jacobson,"""President Donald Trump raised eyebrows April 12 when he retweeted a supporter who had used the hashtag #FireFauci, a reference to Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the nation’s top public health officials who has regularly joined the president on the podium in the White House press room. The tweet that Trump shared was posted by DeAnna Lorraine, a pro-Trump Republican candidate who garnered 1.8% of the vote in an all-primary challenge to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. In the primary, Lorraine finished behind Pelosi, two other Democrats and one other Republican. The tweet came hours after Fauci told CNN’s Jake Tapper that lives could have been saved if the country had """"shut everything down"""" from the beginning. On April 12, Lorraine tweeted, """"Fauci is now saying that had Trump listened to the medical experts earlier he could've saved more lives. Fauci was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large. Time to #FireFauci…"""" Sorry Fake News, it’s all on tape. I banned China long before people spoke up. Thank you @OANN https://t.co/d40JQkUZg5 When we looked closer at Fauci’s public statements on Feb. 29, we found that Lorraine’s tweet is significantly exaggerated. (Lorraine did not respond to an inquiry.) Feb. 29 was a key moment in the course of the virus’ spread, because it was right around the time that public health officials began to suspect that the novel coronavirus had started to infect Americans through """"community spread."""" Community spread means that the virus would be spreading from person to person within a particular community, rather than through cases linked to someone who had brought the virus from a known hot spot elsewhere. On Feb. 28, Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said it was possible that a reported case in California """"could be the first instance of community spread — meaning the illness was acquired through an unknown exposure in the community."""" But it could also be that the patient was exposed through contact to a traveler who was infected, Messonnier said. The immediate risk to the general American public remained low, she said. The following day, a health official from Washington state, where there were four presumptive cases of COVID-19, joined a CDC press briefing and said the state was """"starting to see some spread in the community"""" and the public risk was increasing. """"Should we start to see more spread in Washington, we might consider recommending measures like cancelling large public events,"""" said Kathy Lofy, a Washington state health official. Fauci is interviewed on NBC's """"Today Show"""" on Feb. 29 We found two televised appearances by Fauci on Feb. 29. One was an interview in the morning with Kristen Welker and Peter Alexander on NBC’s Today Show. The other was a press briefing with Trump and other officials that afternoon. On the Today Show, Fauci did say that the lack of widespread, confirmed community spread meant that it was not yet time for radical responses like shutting down large gatherings and businesses. But he did not go as far as the tweet described. He didn’t say that """"there was nothing to worry about"""" or that coronavirus """"posed no threat to the U.S. public at large."""" Instead, his message was that the nation needed to remain vigilant for a possible worst-case scenario. Here are the relevant portions of that interview: Alexander: """"So, Dr. Fauci, it’s Saturday morning in America. People are waking up right now with real concerns about this. They want to go to malls and movies, maybe the gym as well. Should we be changing our habits and, if so, how?"""" Fauci: """"No. Right now, at this moment, there’s no need to change anything that you’re doing on a day by day basis. Right now the risk is still low, but this could change. I’ve said that many times even on this program. You’ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don’t need to change anything you’re doing. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread."""" Welker: """"Dr. Fauci, quickly, how does this all end?"""" Fauci: """"You know, it ends if you -- it depends on the nature of the outbreak. I mean, this could be a major outbreak. I hope not. Or it could be something that’s reasonably well controlled. At the end of the day, this will ultimately go down. Hopefully we could protect the American public from any serious degree of morbidity or mortality. That’s the reason why we’ve got to do the things that we have in our plan."""" With the benefit of a month of hindsight, this may seem like a less-than-ringing endorsement of the types of social distancing policies that would soon become required far and wide. Even so, the tweet exaggerates its case. Fauci repeatedly emphasized the difference between the situation on Feb. 29 and what could happen in the future. In just this two-paragraph exchange, Fauci used the phrases, """"right now, at this moment,"""" """"this could change,"""" """"you’ve got to watch out,"""" and """"this could be a major outbreak."""" Fauci offered a similar message in the afternoon press conference. He said, """"The country as a whole, because we get asked that all the time, still remains at low risk. But when we say that, we want to underscore that this is an evolving situation, and in real time we will keep you apprised of what is going on, just the same way as we are doing it today."""" Later in the briefing, Fauci said, """"We need to prepare for further challenges, and we will have them. You will hear about the additional cases that will be coming on. You should not be surprised by that, but to realize that that is something that is anticipated when you get community spread."""" Lorraine tweeted that Fauci """"was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large."""" This is misleading. Fauci did say on Feb. 29 that rules Americans would come to know as social distancing were not yet warranted.

Betsy McCaughey, chairman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths and former lieutenant governor of New York state, says the bill goes too far to encourage senior citizens to end their lives. On the radio show of former Sen. Fred Thompson on July 16, 2009, McCaughey said """"Congress would make it mandatory — absolutely require — that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner."""" She said those sessions would help the elderly learn how to """"decline nutrition, how to decline being hydrated, how to go in to hospice care ... all to do what's in society's best interest or in your family's best interest and cut your life short."""" Her point has caught on with conservative pundits. On his July 21 show, Rush Limbaugh said the following:   """"Mandatory counseling for all seniors at a minimum of every five years, more often if the seasoned citizen is sick or in a nursing home. ... That's an invasion of the right to privacy. We can't have counseling for mothers who are thinking of terminating their pregnancy, but we can go in there and counsel people about to die."""" McCaughey is no stranger to the health care debate. In 1994, she wrote a scathing review of the Clinton administration's health care plan in the  New Republic,  a left-leaning magazine, arguing that the proposal would lead to rationing of treatment and would prevent patients from choosing health insurance. Republicans seized on the key points of """"No Exit,"""" forcing the Clintons to issue a response to the article. She jumped back into the fray earlier this year while Congress was debating a $787 billion stimulus package. In a Feb. 9 Bloomberg op-ed column, McCaughey criticized the bill for including a plan to monitor health treatments to see which are most cost effective. The elderly, she said, would be denied treatment as a result. Now the Democratic health care bill is in her sights. In her chat with Thompson, McCaughey said the language can be found on page 425 of the health care bill, so we started there. Indeed, Sec. 1233 of the bill, labeled """"Advance Care Planning Consultation"""" details how the bill would, for the first time, require Medicare to cover the cost of end-of-life counseling sessions. According to the bill, """"such consultation shall include the following: An explanation by the practitioner of advance care planning, including key questions and considerations, important steps, and suggested people to talk to; an explanation by the practitioner of advance directives, including living wills and durable powers of attorney, and their uses; an explanation by the practitioner of the role and responsibilities of a health care proxy."""" Medicare will cover one session every five years, the legislation states. If a patient becomes very ill in the interim, Medicare will cover additional sessions. Jon Keyserling, general counsel and vice president of public policy for the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, which supports the provision, said the bill doesn't encourage seniors to end their lives, it just allows some important counseling for decisions that take time and consideration. """"These are very serious conversations,"""" he said. """"It needs to be an informative conversation from the medical side and it needs to be thought about carefully by the patient and their families."""" In no way would these sessions be designed to encourage patients to end their lives, said Jim Dau, national spokeman for AARP, a group that represents people over 50 that has lobbied in support of the advanced planning provision. McCaughey's comments are """"not just wrong, they are cruel,"""" said Dau. """"We want to make sure people are making the right decision. If some one wants to take every life-saving measure, that's their call. Others will decide it's not worth going through this trauma just for themselves and their families, and that's their decision, too."""" Both Keyserling and Dau were particularly troubled that McCaughey insisted — three times, to be exact — that the sessions would be mandatory, which they are not. For his part, Keyserling said he and outside counsel read the language carefully to make sure that was not the case. """"Neither of us can come to the conclusion that it's mandatory."""" he said. """"This new consultation is just like all in Medicare: it's voluntary."""" """"The only thing mandatory is that Medicare will have to pay for the counseling,"""" said Dau. For our ruling on this one, there's really no gray area here. McCaughey incorrectly states that the bill would require Medicare patients to have these counseling sessions and she is suggesting that the government is somehow trying to interfere with a very personal decision. And her claim that the sessions would """"tell [seniors] how to end their life sooner"""" is an outright distortion. Rather, the sessions are an option for elderly patients who want to learn more about living wills, health care proxies and other forms of end-of-life planning.

16293,"""The CDC is """"spending money on things like jazzercise, urban gardening and massage therapy"""" that could be redirected to Ebola.""","October 20, 2014","""Gardner said the CDC is """"spending money on things like jazzercise, urban gardening and massage therapy"""" that could be redirected Ebola. We weren’t able to document such expenditures, but given the agency’s spending parameters, it’s certainly possible they’ve been made. However, by cherry-picking three chuckle- (or outrage-) inducing spending items, Gardner presents a misleading description of what the fund does. Those efforts almost certainly represent a tiny fraction of spending from the prevention fund, which is dominated by efforts to attack diseases that kill more than 1.4 million people every year, rather than one so far with Ebola. The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""",Louis Jacobson,"""As fears over Ebola reached a crescendo, Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., took a shot at the federal government’s handling of the disease during a debate with Democratic Sen. Mark Udall. Gardner has been gaining ground in the closely watched Colorado Senate race, and that contest is just one of many around the country in which Ebola has become an issue. Gardner, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, """"Perhaps the CDC should quit spending money on things like jazzercise, urban gardening and massage therapy and direct that money to where it's appropriate in protecting the health of the American people."""" We wondered if it was true that the government is spending money on jazzercise, urban gardening and the like at the expense of funding for Ebola. We thought this claim deserved a closer look, so we’ll break it down into a few parts. Is the CDC spending money on jazzercise, urban gardening and massage therapy? We couldn’t nail that down for sure, but it’s plausible. We asked both Gardner’s staff and the CDC for documentation of this claim, but neither got back to us with evidence either way. However, we found an unsigned column from the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page -- a leading source of conservative commentary -- that makes that claim. Here’s an excerpt from that editorial, published on Oct. 9, 2014, which focuses on the Prevention and Public Health Fund, or PPHF: """"The PPHF automatically hands the Health and Human Services bureaucracy $15 billion this decade and after that $2 billion a year, with no earmarks, in perpetuity. HHS (of which the CDC is a part) can dip into this honey pot for whatever it pleases. """"In 2013 HHS raided the PPHF of $453.8 million, or 48 percent of that year’s appropriation, to fund the Obamacare insurance exchanges. Those PPHF dollars that have flowed to public health are an insult to this once august field. The PPHF sponsors liberal pressure groups to lobby states and cities for higher tobacco taxes and zoning laws that restrict fast food, and its other urgent causes include dance fitness, massage therapy, painting bike lanes, salad bars in school cafeterias, pet neutering and urban gardening. """"The core of public health used to be society’s interest in securing the conditions necessary for human survival—mainly meaning epidemiology and combating communicable diseases. The pity is that all too often the current CDC has diluted its mission and budget by funding political causes that the doctors and troops in West Africa (and Texas) don’t need. The list extends to anti-bullying, trans fats, prescription opiate abuse, college rape prevention, workplace wellness, ‘racial and ethnic approaches to community health,’ and promoting breast feeding."""" We’ll set aside the editorial’s belittling tone toward efforts to combat bullying, drug abuse and rape, and instead investigate the questions it raises about the fund and how it allocates funding. The fund was established with the passage of the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare) in 2010. Initially, it was supposed to be funded by $15 billion over its first 10 years; legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama in 2012 cut that amount by $5 billion over 10 years. The purpose of the fund is """"to provide expanded and sustained national investments in prevention and public health, to improve health outcomes, and to enhance health care quality."""" In practice, CDC provides grants to local governments and nonprofits, who then decide how to spend the money to meet public health goals. However, the fund has proved to be """"a tempting target for policy makers of both parties,"""" according to an analysis of the fund published in the journal Health Affairs. The authors of the Health Affairs analysis wrote that it """"got off to a rocky start,"""" due to complaints by both liberals and conservatives. Liberals expressed concern that Obama was gutting the fund by agreeing to the cuts, which supported the continuation of payroll tax breaks, an extension of unemployment benefits and a """"fix"""" to prevent cuts to physician reimbursement under Medicare -- items that had little if anything to do with preventing disease. Conservatives, for their part, questioned whether the fund needed to exist at all, particularly in a time of growing federal debt. Some Republicans proposed eliminating the fund and using some of the proceeds to pay for repeal of the Affordable Care Act's requirement that small-business owners file 1099 tax reporting forms, Health Affairs reported. Meanwhile, Republicans also questioned whether the government should be paying for things that people can do for free, like exercise. Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., the ranking member on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, dismissed it as a """"slush fund ... to build sidewalks, jungle gyms, and swing sets."""" We were only able to document broad categories of spending from the fund; once we drilled down into online disclosure forms for grants, they didn’t cite such specific details as """"jazzercise,"""" """"urban gardening"""" or """"massage therapy."""" But when we asked public-health experts whether such categories could have been spent on the kinds of activities Gardner criticized, they said it’s likely. The fund’s mission is to """"improve health and prevent chronic illnesses by expanding preventive care and supporting proven community-based programs that reduce obesity, tobacco use and other preventable conditions, and I would think that healthy food and physical activity efforts would fit right in,"""" said Elizabeth Rigby, an associate professor of public policy and public administration at George Washington University. Glen Mays, a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Public Health, agreed. """"Are there scientifically proven prevention strategies that involve helping people reach recommended levels of daily exercise through organized group activities like ‘jazzercise, urban gardening, or other forms of physical activity? Absolutely,"""" Mays said, citing CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Program and WISEWOMAN program. """"Beyond their exercise benefits, gardening programs also have been shown to increase knowledge of and access to healthy food choices, especially in urban and rural food deserts,"""" Mays said, and in certain contexts, massage therapy could fit as well. Bottom line: We aren’t 100 percent sure that CDC dollars have been spent on jazzercise, urban gardens or massage therapy, but it’s quite possible they have been. Does Gardner’s focus accurately describe what the fund does? No, it’s pretty misleading. Here’s a flavor of how CDC plans to spend money from the Prevention and Public Health Fund in fiscal year 2014. (CDC is only one of several federal agencies that’s able to spend money from the fund, though we’ll limit our analysis to CDC because of how Gardner framed his claim.) • Immunization: $160 million; • Smoking prevention: $105 million; • Cancer prevention and control: $104 million; • Heart disease and stroke prevention: $77 million; • Diabetes prevention: $73 million; • Epidemiology and laboratory capacity: $40 million; • Nutrition, physical activity, and obesity: $39 million; • Racial and ethnic approaches to community health: $30 million; • Lead poisoning prevention: $13 million; • Infection prevention in health care facilities: $12 million; • Workplace wellness: $10 million; • Breastfeeding promotion and support: $8 million; • Miscellaneous prevention efforts: $160 million; The total for all these activities: $831 million. More than half went for categories that would be irrelevant for the items Gardner cites. And even within the $300 million-plus spent on items such as preventing obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer, experts are certain that items such as jazzercise represent a tiny fraction of what CDC is spending. The plan’s critics have chosen the silliest-sounding items -- an effective rhetorical tactic, but not a very honest one. (As for the Wall Street Journal editorial’s complaint that CDC has abandoned its traditional role in """"combating communicable diseases,"""" we’ll note that the single biggest spending item from the fund is for immunizations.) How solid is the argument that prevention funding should be shifted to Ebola? When the preventive fund was created, lawmakers explicitly tilted the authority for disbursing the funds toward the executive branch, rather than Congress, so there shouldn’t be insurmountable roadblocks to shifting money around. So CDC -- or the agency it reports to, the Department of Health and Human Services -- could probably switch dollars around if it wished. But as it happens, there’s really no need to switch money out of the fund, since the fund can be used directly to pay for Ebola expenses. Remember that $12 million we noted above that’s targeted for """"infection prevention in health care facilities"""" for 2014? That’s relevant because, """"right now in the United States, Ebola is exclusively a hospital-acquired infection,"""" Mays said. Indeed, Mays added, the prevention fund is already funding the CDC’s Epidemiology, Laboratory Capacity, and Emerging Infections program, which """"supports exactly the types of testing, contact tracing, and remediation activities that are underway by state and local health departments in Texas and Ohio in response to Ebola."""" So Gardner is confusing matters by making it prevention vs. Ebola. It doesn’t have to be. There’s also another issue to consider. We can see why people might chuckle at the thought of federal money going to jazzercise, but it’s important not to lose sight of the fund’s purpose -- prevention. """"Prevention"""" has been part of the official name of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 1992, when George H.W. Bush was president. The """"P"""" never made it into the agency’s common acronym -- and prevention is not as swashbuckling a sector as some divisions of CDC -- but it’s an important part of the agency’s mission nonetheless. Why? Take a look at the death statistics for diseases covered by grants from the fund. (The figures cover 2010, the most recent year available). • Heart disease: 596,577 deaths; • Cancer: 576,691 deaths; • Stroke: 128,932 deaths; • Diabetes: 73,831 deaths; • Influenza and Pneumonia: 53,826 deaths. That’s more than 1.4 million deaths annually from what medical experts, including the CDC, consider preventable diseases -- compared to (so far) just one from Ebola in the United States. This doesn’t mean we should be spending zero on Ebola; nor does it mean the fund can prevent anything approaching to 1.4 million deaths a year. It doesn’t even mean that the fund is spending the right amount of money, or for the right things. What it does mean is that Gardner’s flip dismissal of preventive-health efforts obscures the imbalance in the number of lives at stake every year. Our ruling Gardner said the CDC is """"spending money on things like jazzercise, urban gardening and massage therapy"""" that could be redirected Ebola. We weren’t able to document such expenditures, but given the agency’s spending parameters, it’s certainly possible they’ve been made. However, by cherry-picking three chuckle- (or outrage-) inducing spending items, Gardner presents a misleading description of what the fund does. Those efforts almost certainly represent a tiny fraction of spending from the prevention fund, which is dominated by efforts to attack diseases that kill more than 1.4 million people every year, rather than one so far with Ebola.

The fact is, the CDC’s database includes a clear warning that the there is no evidence the reported cases are related to vaccines.

We decided to fact-check Sears’ claim that between 3,000 and 4,500 people report severe vaccine reactions that """"land somebody in the hospital, the intensive care unit or cause a permanent disability or death."""" What the CDC says, and doesn’t say The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does maintain a database of reported cases of adverse reactions to vaccines. It’s called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS for short. The system allows almost anyone -- from a doctor to a nurse to a pharmacist to a patient or parent -- to enter in any information about illnesses or medical issues that follow someone receiving a vaccine. The information is collected so that officials can spot possible trends or side effects related to particular vaccines. Before we show you the numbers for 2014, we’ll give you the same warning the CDC provides any user. It’s a warning Sears failed to present CNN viewers. """"When evaluating data from VAERS, it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause-and-effect relationship has been established. Reports of all possible associations between vaccines and adverse events (possible side effects) are filed in VAERS. Therefore, VAERS collects data on any adverse event following vaccination, be it coincidental or truly caused by a vaccine. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event."""" We’ll say that again in our own words. There’s no proof that a vaccine caused any of the medical conditions reported in the database. That colors Sears’ statement significantly. """"There’s absolutely no linkage between cause and effect,"""" Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center, told us. """"If I received the flu vaccine yesterday and got hit by a bus today, I could enter that into VAERS. But I doubt anyone would say the vaccine caused the accident. VAERS is a great reporting system to look for trends that would trigger further studies – but it does not pretend to prove that the conditions entered are related to vaccination."""" Now back to the numbers. Sears specifically mentioned three outcomes that he described as """"severe vaccine reactions"""" --  hospitalization, permanent disability, or death. (There is no category to report someone being sent to an """"intensive care unit,"""" nor is there a searchable category for """"severe vaccine reactions."""") We looked at 2014 VEARS data, which covers reports processed as of Dec. 14, 2014. VAERS data shows (as of Feb. 3, 2015): 1,244 cases of people reported hospitalized 416 cases of people reporting a disability 122 reported deaths 388 reported life-threatening cases That’s a total of 2,170 events, but once you factor out double and sometimes triple counting -- meaning a reported death could also could include a reported disability or hospitalization -- you drop to a total of 1,737 cases. (The numbers change slightly depending on how you run the search. We searched when cases were reported. Since the database is a living document, the numbers may also shift if you choose to run this calculation yourself.) On the flip side, the 2014 count is only through Dec. 14, meaning that additional cases likely will be reported before the CDC closes out the year. Sears’ defense We presented our findings to Sears, who said he approached his calculation in a more generic way. He said he looked at VAERS in December 2009. """"At that time, the site reported the number of severe reactions each year going back many years. It averaged out at about 30,000 total reactions reported yearly, and the site stated that between 10 percent and 15 percent of these were serious. That's how I get the number 3,000 to 4,500,"""" Sears said. """"Now, that fluctuates every year. Some years are lower, some higher,"""" Sears said. """"You looked at 2014 data, which looks to be about 1,750. That's a low year."""" Here, Sears has a point. In fact, the CDC website does still include a general description that matches what Sears told us. """"Approximately 30,000 VAERS reports are filed annually, with 10-15% classified as serious (resulting in permanent disability, hospitalization, life-threatening illnesses or death),"""" the CDC says. But that didn’t amount to 3,500-4,000 cases in 2014, nor any year we searched as far back as 2006. Sears is correct that 2014 appears to be a low year. Year Cases of reported hospitalization, disability, deaths or life-threatening illness 2014 1,737 2013 1,837 2012 1,934 2011 2,045 2010 2,570 2009 2,701 2008 2,465 2007 2,289 2006 1,477 Other data on vaccine injuries As we’ve written, the major flaw in the VAERS data is that it does not prove a link between the vaccine and an illness. One area where we get closer to finding a causal link is through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The program, created on Oct. 1, 1988, was set up to help compensate victims found to be injured by certain vaccines. The program is funded by a $0.75 excise tax on vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for routine administration to children, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. According to Health and Human Services, 3,887 compensation awards have been paid since the first claims were filed in 1989. Another 9,860 claims were dismissed. A total of 633 petitions were filed seeking payment in fiscal year 2014. Petitions peaked in fiscal year 2003 when 2,592 claims were filed. This data is far from perfect. But what it shows is that in the last 25 years, the fund has paid out claims to 3,887 people -- which translates to an average of 155 paid claims per year. Health and Human Services cautions that settlements do not indicate safety concerns about the vaccine alleged to cause the injury. """"Settlements are not an admission by the United States or the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the vaccine caused the petitioner’s alleged injuries,"""" officials write. """"The vaccine compensation program ... provides a bit more linkage between cause and effect, but the rulings are decided in a court of law, and science may or may not play a big role in the finding,"""" Troisi told us. """"It’s also very hard to prove cause and effect on an individual case, which is what is happening with these findings."""" Our ruling Sears said, """"Every year in the United States between 3,000 and 4,500 severe vaccine reactions are reported to the Centers for Disease Control. Not mild reactions. Severe reactions that land somebody in the hospital, the intensive care unit or cause a permanent disability or death.""""

Propylene Glycol is just another name for Antifreeze!! !” It’s true that propylene glycol is listed as an ingredient in Canine Carry Outs dog treats, but that doesn’t mean that they are hazardous to your dog’s health. In fact, chances are that many pet owners that worry about feeding their dogs propylene glycol eat or drink it themselves on a regular basis.

If you eat food products, use cosmetics or take medications that contain it, you will be exposed to propylene glycol, but these amounts are not considered harmful.” The FDA says that humans and pets can safely eat propylene glycol if it doesn’t account for more than 5% of total food intake.

21957,"""Sandy Pasch Says U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan promised to """"end health care for our seniors.""","June 10, 2011",Democratic Wisconsin state Rep. Sandy Pasch says GOP U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget plan would end health care for seniors,Tom Kertscher,"""When some Democrats look at the federal budget plan proposed by House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., it’s as if they’ve caught sight of a tiki bar at the end of a hot summer day. They aren’t envisioning fruity drinks with tiny umbrellas, but rather electoral victories. The Democrats see Ryan’s plan, particularly its changes to Medicare, as distasteful to voters and therefore an advantage for their party. As evidence, they point to Democrat Kathy Hochul’s upset win in a western New York congressional race that was dominated by Ryan’s Medicare plan. That special election was held May 24, 2011, less than two months after Ryan released his plan, which would convert Medicare into a """"premium-support payment"""" program starting in 2022. On June 6, 2011, Wisconsin state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, was asked in an online chat how Ryan would affect elections on another level. Pasch is running in a recall election against state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, who aims to retain a seat she has held since 1992. It is one of an unprecedented nine state senator recall elections that will be held in Wisconsin in July 2011. In the chat, which was sponsored by Blue America, a political action committee that says it works to elect progressives, a questioner asked:  """"I just read that (Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman) Mike Tate says that Paul Ryan will be a central focus in the recall elections. I hadn't heard that before. Will it work? Is it that connected in people's minds? Or is it too abstract for the average voter to make the connection?"""" Pasch, a second-term lawmaker who formerly worked as a nurse and nursing professor for 30 years, gave this response:  """"I think that Paul Ryan is the face of the radical plan to dismantle Medicare and Medicaid. People across Wisconsin depend on and like Medicare. If you stand with Paul Ryan, you stand with the promise to end health care for our seniors. It's not just a policy issue, it's a values issue."""" So, according to Pasch, Ryan promised to end health care for senior citizens. No health care? That would be one stiff drink to swallow. Before we assess Pasch’s defense of her claim, a little background. Ryan’s budget -- passed by the GOP-controlled House, 235-193, but defeated in the Democrat-controlled Senate, 57-40 -- would make dramatic changes to Medicare if it ever became law. As it exists now, Medicare is government health insurance for people age 65 and over and for people under 65 with certain disabilities. It helps pay for doctor visits, inpatient and outpatient hospital care, other services and prescription drugs. Under Ryan’s plan, people who turn 65 before 2022 would remain in traditional Medicare, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Those who turn 65 in 2022 or after, the budget office said, would get a """"premium support payment"""" from Medicare. Rather than getting health insurance from the government, Medicare recipients would use the payment toward the cost of buying private health insurance. That’s a major change. Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that future Medicare recipients """"would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system."""" But when MoveOn.org declared that Ryan’s budget """"abolishes Medicare within 10 years,"""" the left-leaning political advocacy group earned a False from us, given that Medicare would change but not go away. Other critics, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, haven’t gone as far, arguing instead that Ryan’s plan would end Medicare """"as we know it."""" But when Wasserman Schultz also claimed that under Ryan’s Medicare, insurance companies could """"deny you coverage and drop you for pre-existing conditions,"""" she got a False from our colleagues at PolitiFact National. Yet Pasch goes even further, claiming Ryan has promised to """"end health care for our seniors."""" Not just Medicare, but """"health care."""" Now to Pasch’s defense. Pasch’s campaign manager, Phil Walzak, argued in an email to us that, under Ryan’s proposal, Medicare recipients would """"lose a guaranteed set of health benefits"""" because they would instead receive money to be used toward buying private health insurance. He also predicted that Medicare recipients would get fewer benefits even though they would be paying more for their health care. He cited analyses by the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the National Academy of Social Insurance. For her part, Pasch herself was more measured in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin than she was in the online chat, saying Ryan’s plan """"is clearly a move toward not promising health care to seniors."""" She went on to say that as senior citizens are forced to pay more for health insurance, they will """"start neglecting their health care."""" It’s time for the tab from our political tiki bar. Pasch originally claimed that Ryan promised to end health care for seniors and now she says his Medicare plan is a """"move toward not promising health care to seniors."""" That’s quite a step back from the original claim.

15920,"Mercury is used in vaccines, and there is no safe level of mercury.","February 11, 2015","Anti-vaccine claim rooted in bad science, confusion",April Hunt,"""With a measles outbreak sprouting in 14 states, and Georgia reporting its first case in almost three years, vaccine opponents are reviving claims about the dangers of vaccines against the disease in newsfeeds across the country. An alert reader was skeptical of one Facebook post, reviving a 2012 story that purports to list """"10 outrageous (but true) facts."""" It starts with the claim that helped spur the anti-vaccination movement, despite being repeatedly debunked: Childhood shots contain mercury, a powerful neurotoxin with no safe level of use. """"Doctors who inject children with vaccines are delusional,"""" Mike Adams concludes from his list of claims. """"They are practicing a medical holocaust against humanity."""" How could PolitiFact Georgia resist jumping in to such subtlety? Adams declined to speak with us about his conclusions regarding mercury. He referred us instead to studies on his website, most of which deal with effects of methyl mercury. That is a very different chemical from ethyl mercury, a component in the vaccine preservative thimerosal. We’ll get to that difference in a minute. But the story of thimerosal and vaccine safety bears repeating. Early vaccinations carried the risk of dangerous and sometimes lethal bacterial infections, such as a staph infection that killed four children in 1916. Thimerosal was added to vaccines to keep multi-dose vials free from such bacteria starting in the 1930s. In 1998, the British medical journal the Lancet published a paper that claimed there was a link between the MMR vaccine — for measles, mumps and rubella — and autism. The paper by Dr. Andrew Wakefield drew considerable publicity and is credited in pushing vaccination rates down in the United Kingdom and the United States. In 1999, the Food and Drug Administration held meetings to discuss the idea that thimerosal — then used in three childhood vaccines such as the hepatitis B shot — was damaging immunized infants’ brains and contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses. At the time, Dr. Neal Halsey was the chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases. The Johns Hopkins pediatrician had long pushed for expanding vaccinations as a way for children to live healthier lives. But he was willing to entertain the idea that thimerosal was helping to impair infant brains, even though there were no data to support the theory. Thimerosal was removed and has not been used as a preservative in any vaccine on the recommended schedule for children since 1999. By 2004, Wakefield's study was retracted and would later be deemed an """"elaborate fraud"""" by the British medical journal BMJ. Wakefield eventually lost his medical license over the ordeal. At the same time, several studies, including ones in 2001 and 2004 from the Institute of Medicine, found no evidence linking vaccines and autism. """"There was no convincing evidence that there was any harm from thimerosal, but I felt we would have difficulties with public acceptance of vaccines if we continued its use,"""" Halsey said. """"We are not using it anymore. Now the science is definitive that the small amount of thimerosal did not cause autism or any other neurological damage. """" The damage may already have been done, though, regarding public suspicion of vaccines. Like Halsey, Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrics professor at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, agreed that the science never supported the theory that thimerosal caused harm. But Offit worried attention to the unproven fear of """"mercury"""" was minimizing the proven fear of the diseases the vaccines were designed to keep at bay. """"Before there were vaccines, whooping cough killed 8,000 children a year, polio crippled 20,000 kids and killed 1,500 to 2,000,"""" Offit said. """"Measles killed 500 children a year and caused 48,000 to be hospitalized. The best way to address safety concerns is not to cater to false ones and focus on those real threats."""" Adams also confuses the issue with the interchangeable use of the term """"mercury"""" for both thimerosal’s ethyl mercury and the more problematic methyl mercury. Think of ethyl mercury like ethyl alcohol — easily expelled from the human body but dangerous in large quantities. Thimerosal was used in trace amounts in vaccines. Methyl mercury is the compound found in fish and water, which builds up because the body can’t easily expel it. While some amounts occur naturally in the environment, it’s more comparable to methyl alcohol, the methanol that fills your gas tank but isn’t fit for human consumption. Repeated research studies agree that there is no evidence of harm from thimerosal’s mercury compound in vaccines. But there is an even bigger problem with Adams’ claim. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, aware of the controversy and confusion, lists all ingredients in childhood vaccines for review. MMR, the vaccine making headlines now, never contained thimerosal. Neither did the shots for chickenpox, polio or others. Thimerosal, remember, was designed to prevent bacterial growth with repeated entry into a vial. Therefore, it wouldn’t be used in single-use vials most common in the United States. And there is no need for a preservative with the live virus vaccines such as measles, said Dr. Marie McCormick, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who oversaw the committee that conducted the 2004 IOM vaccine safety review. In other words, our reader was right to be skeptical. There has been debate in the scientific community about removing a mercury compound from some vaccines. But the science has always been clear that there is no evidence that compound causes harm. Bluntly, vaccines help, not hurt. And if you still don’t believe that? Consider that the recipe in question — that is, the series of shots recommended for childhood immunization — does not include the ingredient singled out as the problem. Any claims to the contrary muddy what should be a simple issue.""","http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mmr.pdf, http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2010/09/13/peds.2010-0309.abstract, http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2004/05/iom-finds-no-link-between-thimerosal-and-autism, http://www2.aap.org/pressroom/issuekitfiles/MercuryLevelsinNewbornsAfterThimerosolVaccines.pdf, https://jpepsy.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/1/106.long, http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/thimerosal/, http://www.vaccinesafety.edu/cc-thim.htm, http://vec.chop.edu/service/vaccine-education-center/home.html, http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/thimerosal/thimerosal_faqs.html, http://www.naturalnews.com/042012_vaccine_facts_vaccine-damaged_children_CDC.html, http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452?sid=33c5a12b-0147-48c8-a6db-cb761db43e39",false,"Georgia, Public Health, Mike Adams, "

A 5-4 majority ruled that a closely held, private corporation, such as the craft retailer Hobby Lobby, could decline on religious grounds to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. One of the most closely watched responses was by Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State who is the presumptive frontrunner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton addressed the case during a question-and-answer session at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado. Clinton blasted the decision as """"deeply disturbing."""" """"It’s very troubling that a salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who needs contraception, which is pretty expensive, is not going to get that service through her employer’s health care plan because her employer doesn’t think she should be using contraception,"""" Clinton said. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker reviewed this claim and gave it Two Pinocchios, out of a maximum of four. We thought we’d take our own look. First, some background. The company’s owners say they object to four out of the 20 Food and Drug Administration-approved forms of contraception -- the four that prevent implantation of the embryo. These include two forms of """"emergency contraception,"""" sometimes called the """"morning-after pill,"""" and two forms of intra-uterine devices, or IUDs. (Officially, the FDA considers these four methods to be """"contraception,"""" but the company’s Christian owners consider them to be a form of abortion.) According to the Wall Street Journal, the company actually supported all 20 forms of contraception until 2012, when the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty informed Hobby Lobby about the Affordable Care Act’s contraception requirement. Owner David Green told the Journal that he was """"shocked"""" at the discovery. He proceeded to revoke the coverage and file the suit that was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court on June 30, 2014. Contrary to Clinton’s claim, Hobby Lobby’s website says the company does in fact support the other 16 forms of contraception. Here are some excerpts from its Frequently Asked Questions page: Q: Is Hobby Lobby preventing its employees from buying contraceptives under its plan? A: Not at all. The Greens (the family that owns the company) and their family businesses respect the individual liberties of all their employees. The Greens and their family businesses have no objection to the other 16 FDA-approved contraceptives required by the law that do not interfere with the implantation of a fertilized egg. They provide coverage for such contraceptives under their health care plan. Additionally, the four objectionable drugs and devices are widely available and affordable, and employees are free to obtain them. Q: But isn’t Hobby Lobby depriving its women employees of health care? A: Just the opposite: the Greens and their family businesses, including Hobby Lobby Stores Inc., offer their employees – nearly 70 percent of whom are women – a robust benefit plan that includes coverage for preventive care and almost all of the contraceptives required under the Affordable Care Act. That plan includes an on-site clinic with no co-pay at Hobby Lobby headquarters, and all full-time employees are eligible to enroll in a generous benefit plan: including medical, dental, prescription drugs, along with long-term disability and life insurance, and a 401(k) plan with a generous company match. For the record, the 16 contraceptives the company supports, according to a Hobby Lobby spokeswoman, are: male condoms; female condoms; diaphragms with spermicide; sponges with spermicide; cervical caps with spermicide; spermicide alone; birth-control pills with estrogen and progestin; birth-control pills with progestin alone; birth control pills, extended or continuous use; contraceptive patches; contraceptive rings; progestin injections; implantable rods; vasectomies; female sterilization surgeries; female sterilization implants. Of course, not all of these forms will be equally useful to the salesclerk, particularly vasectomies and male condoms. Still, they include some of the most widely used forms of contraception, including several varieties of the birth-control pill. We found no evidence to dispute the company’s assertion that it pays for 16 out of 20 forms of contraception. So Clinton goes too far when she says the salesclerk """"is not going to get"""" contraception through the company’s health care plan. And the fact that the company pays for 16 types undercuts Clinton’s claim that Hobby Lobby """"doesn’t think she should be using contraception."""" Where Clinton’s claim includes a grain of truth is that the salesclerk will not have an unfettered choice in what form of contraception she gets. Say the salesclerk is unable, for medical reasons, to use the birth control pill. An IUD might be a good alternative, but it would not be available to her under Hobby Lobby’s health care plan. IUD use has been increasing in recent years, and paying for one out-of-pocket means significant up-front expenses. If IUD implantation is taken off the table, the salesclerk may be forced to choose another method -- one that may be less well-suited to the employee. There’s another nuance that leave this question in something of a gray area. The way the decision was written leaves some question about whether closely held, religious companies can choose to opt out of supporting any of the remaining 16 forms of contraception in their health plans. For the record, a spokeswoman said that Hobby Lobby """"will continue to cover all 16,"""" but that may not be the case for other companies. Already, some companies have been allowed by lower courts to stop paying for a wider range of contraceptives than were at issue in the Hobby Lobby case, according to the Associated Press. Their cases are likely to work their way through the courts, and the Supreme Court has let those policies stand pending further appeals. While the Hobby Lobby decision may open the door to judicial acceptance of more sweeping contraceptive bans, the specific comment we’re checking targeted Hobby Lobby -- and it’s significantly flawed. """"To the extent she was talking about Hobby Lobby as an employer specifically, I think Clinton overstated her case,"""" said I. Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology & Bioethics at Havard Law School. He added, """"It may be true for a subset of employees, and to the extent she was also referring to other potential employers who might ban all contraceptives, I think she is on firmer ground."""" Our ruling Clinton said that """"a salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who needs contraception … is not going to get that service through her employer’s health care plan because her employer doesn’t think she should be using contraception."""" There’s reason to believe that future court decisions could allow companies to forgo payment for all types of birth control, but Clinton’s claim refers specifically to Hobby Lobby’s policies toward its employees.

We also rated as  its claim that members of Congress can """"retire with the same pay after only one term.""""

The latest is to exempt themselves from the healthcare reform, in all of its forms."""" PolitiFact first examined the claim that members of Congress are exempt from the provisions of the Affordable Care Act in 2009, when the legislation was still under consideration in Congress. That claim was based on the assumption that the health care reform plan would have sent everyone -- except Congress -- into a new """"public option"""" federal insurance plan. It would not have. In fact, the law as passed did not even include a public option -- and Section 1213 of it requires members of Congress and congressional staff, starting in 2014, to buy health plans created by the health care act or offered through the state exchanges the act establishes. Political scientist Norman Ornstein, a long-time observer of Congress and a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, debunked the claim of congressional exemption in a piece he wrote for the Washington newspaper Roll Call. """"On the assertion that Members of Congress are exempt from the provisions of the Affordable Care Act: also false,"""" he wrote. """"Members of Congress are subject under the health care reform law to the same mandate that others are to purchase insurance, and their plans must have the same minimum standards of benefits that other insurance plans will have to meet. Members of Congress currently have not a gold-plated free plan but the same insurance options that most other federal employees have, and they do not have it provided for free. They have a generous subsidy for their premiums, but no more generous (and compared to many businesses or professions less generous) than standard employer-provided subsidies throughout the country."""" FactCheck.org examined the broader claim that members of Congress """"specifically exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed (such as being exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment),"""" and found it """"15 years out of date"""" in 2010. The reason: Passage of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. It specifically made sure a variety of laws dealing with civil rights, labor and workplace safety regulations applied to the legislative branch of government. The independent Office of Compliance was set up to enforce the laws in Congress. The act specifically prohibits harassment based on sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age and disability. Ornstein, who has been sharply critical of Congress (and only last month co-authored a piece for Foreign Policy magazine titled """"Yes, Congress Is That Bad"""") said it is """"not surprising that, in tough times, Americans would be inclined to believe the absolute worst about their elected officials. """"But at least,"""" he added, """"let the criticism be fair and based on facts instead of persistent urban legends."""" PolitiFact Ohio would agree.

This is one of many unverified claims about the novel coronavirus. At first, the reasoning might make sense. There is, in fact, some evidence that viruses don’t like heat. """"The droplets that carry viruses do not stay suspended in humid air as long, and the warmer temperatures lead to more rapid virus degradation,"""" Elizabeth McGraw, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University, recently told Time Magazine. But, at this point, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control isn’t sure the sun or heat will affect COVID-19 the same way. CDC physician and researcher Nancy Messionnier said on Feb. 12 that """"it’s premature to assume"""" the heat and sunlight will temper the virus. """"We haven’t been through even a single year with this pathogen,"""" she told NPR. Sun exposure can also raise a person’s vitamin D levels, potentially reducing the incidence of acute respiratory infection, Harvard University professor Marc Lipsitch wrote in his recent paper: """"Seasonality of SARS-CoV-2: Will COVID-19 go away on its own in warmer weather?"""" But, Lipsitch wrote, """"On the other hand, we found that this effect was unlikely to be a large factor in the variation in influenza incidence between summer and winter."""" Neither the World Health Organization nor the U.S. Centers for Disease Control list sunlight exposure as a method for preventing the coronavirus. In fact, on its """"mythbusters"""" webpage, the WHO says COVID-19 can be transmitted in all climates, """"including areas with hot and humid weather."""" One reason people might believe sunlight can kill the virus is because sunlight contains ultraviolet light. In Rep. Murphy’s video, he stands next to a white board that mentions UV light from the sun. High-intensity UV light can indeed kill viruses. But natural sunlight doesn’t provide the UV light intensity needed to kill the virus, according to Rachel Graham, assistant professor of epidemiology at the UNG Gillings School of Global Public Health. """"Exposing surfaces to plain sunlight should not be considered sanitation,"""" she said, adding: """"I would never ever, ever rely on sunlight to kill coronavirus."""" Graham’s claim about UV light is supported by Sally Bloomfield, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. To kill a virus, temperatures must rise to about 140 degrees fahrenheit, Bloomfield told the BBC. Murphy said """"sunlight actually can kill the virus."""" This claim has not been proven true. His whiteboard mentioned UV light in sunlight. But experts claim the UV rays in sunlight aren’t intense enough to COVID-19. We found no conclusive evidence that someone could prevent the virus by exposing themselves to the sun for long periods of time. And we found no evidence that sunlight exposure could help an infected person defeat the virus.""","https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html, https://twitter.com/RepGregMurphy/status/1239604975933755392?s=20, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51735367, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html, https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/08/WS5e3eb7aea31012821727601d.html, https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/12/805256402/can-coronavirus-be-crushed-by-warmer-weather, https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/will-covid-19-go-away-on-its-own-in-warmer-weather/, https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/can-uv-light-fight-spread-influenza, https://time.com/5790880/coronavirus-warm-weather-summer/, https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/16/viral-image/gargling-salt-water-can-ease-sore-throat-it-wont-k/, https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public, https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/11/facebook-posts/sun-exposure-does-not-kill-coronavirus/",false,"Public Health, North Carolina, Coronavirus, Greg Murphy, "
26758,Facebook post Says President Barack Obama “waited six months to call swine flu an emergency after thousands died.”,"March 4, 2020","The Obama administration declared swine flu, or H1N1, a public health emergency six weeks before H1N1 was declared a pandemic. No H1N1 deaths had yet been recorded in the United States. Six months after that initial declaration, when more than 1,000 deaths had occurred, Obama himself declared H1N1 a national emergency.",Tom Kertscher,"""President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus is being defended with an attack on how President Barack Obama handled the outbreak of H1N1, also known as swine flu, in 2009. The headline of an article shared on Facebook made this claim: """"Flashback: Obama waited six months to call swine flu an emergency after thousands died."""" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article was published on Prntly, which describes itself as a conservative news website that defends Trump. The article goes on to say that """"it wasn’t until six months after"""" H1N1 became a global pandemic that """"then-President Obama declared a public health emergency on what was already a pandemic. By that time, the disease had infected millions of Americans and more than 1,000 people had died in the U.S."""" Not only is this timeline wrong, but the story and headline eliminate important facts and distort others, imparting a  narrative that social media users are resharing. Let’s take a look. Online, fact-based news is going to be very important in the coming weeks. Please consider donating to PolitiFact today. The H1N1 influenza virus was discovered in the United States in the spring of 2009 and spread around the world. It was originally referred to as """"swine flu"""" because many genes in the virus were similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America. It was serious. From April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, in the United States, there were 60.8 million cases of swine flu, 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated. Obama and his administration issued two emergency declarations, but the article refers only to one. Obama’s acting director of health and human services declared H1N1 a public health emergency on April 26, 2009. That was when only 20 cases of H1N1 — and no deaths — around the country had been confirmed. Two days later, the administration made an initial funding request for H1N1 to Congress. Eventually $7.65 billion was allocated for a vaccine and other measures. H1N1 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on June 11, 2009. In other words, the Obama administration’s public health emergency declaration came more than six weeks before the pandemic designation. Now to Obama’s second action. On Oct. 24, 2009, six months after his administration declared H1N1 a public health emergency, Obama declared it a national emergency. At that point, H1N1 had claimed more than 1,000 American lives, according to the CDC. When Obama made his declaration, the New York Times reported at the time, thousands of people were lining up in cities across the country to receive vaccinations, as federal officials acknowledged that their vaccination program had gotten off to a slow start, with some states having requested 10 times the amount they have been allotted. Millions of people in the United States had had H1N1. The national emergency declaration allowed the federal government to temporarily waive or modify requirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance programs. It also permitted doctors and hospitals to bypass certain requirements as they responded to H1N1. By way of comparison, Trump declared the coronavirus a public health emergency on Jan. 31, 2020, also prior to any deaths in the United States. One effect was that U.S. citizens who had been in China's Hubei Province, the source of the outbreak, in the previous 14 days were subjected to 14 days of mandatory quarantine if they traveled back to the United States. NBC News reported March 3, 2020, that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is planning for the possibility that Trump could make a national emergency declaration to bring in extra funds and personnel to assist the administration's coronavirus response. The headline of an article shared on Facebook claimed: """"Obama waited six months to call swine flu an emergency after thousands died."""" In October 2009, after more than 1,000 people in the United States had died of swine flu, also known as H1N1, Obama declared a national emergency. But six months earlier, his administration declared H1N1 a public health emergency. At that point, no deaths in the United States had occurred.""","https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/mcm/h1n1-retrospective/Documents/h1n1-retrospective.pdf, https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/frequently_asked_questions/about_disease/en/, https://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/10/24/h1n1.obama/index.html, https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html, https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/world/27flu.html, https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-wait-swine-flu-n1h1/, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/realitycheck/the-press-office/declaration-a-national-emergency-with-respect-2009-h1n1-influenza-pandemic-0, https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/swineflu/16606, https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/us/politics/25flu.html, https://prntly.com/2020/02/29/flashback-obama-waited-6-months-to-call-swine-flu-an-emergency-after-thousands-died/?fbclid=IwAR3r2RoaoRoUMZBD-4PlDSFP2_HSfVRpyQxrIhycdSg8cCshRrZ0_1cSEb4, https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/qa.htm, https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/who/",false,"Public Health, Facebook Fact-checks, Coronavirus, Facebook posts, "

Scott said the centers weren't needed. But they’ve helped over a million Florida women who’ve been sexually assaulted get care, counseling and legal help. These centers were a place for women who have nowhere else to turn. And Rick Scott turned his back on every single one of them."""" (Technically the Florida Democratic Party released the ad, but the Crist campaign has promoted it.) The ad leaves viewers with the impression that Scott completely rejected funding for rape crisis centers, a serious attack against the governor. Did Scott veto funding for 30 rape crisis centers and say that the centers weren’t needed? Scott’s veto The state funds rape crisis centers through various pots of money. A portion comes from the Rape Crisis Trust Fund, which comes from fines assessed on felony criminal defendants. Additionally, some money comes from the Attorney General’s Office, and in some years the Legislature and governor approved additional money. In the fine print, the ad cites a TV report from April 2012. In 2012, Scott vetoed $1.5 million of additional money for the rape crisis centers. The 30 centers still received $1.4 million from the Trust Fund and $500,000 from the attorney general. The Florida Council Against Sexual Violence, which lobbies on behalf of the centers, issued a statement criticizing the veto, """"especially when the need for increased funding is so clear, waiting lists for core services are growing, and programs can’t meet the needs of those whose lives have been devastated by sexual violence."""" Scott’s veto during Sexual Assault Awareness Month drew much scrutiny -- especially in left-leaning websites. The TV ad says """"Scott said the centers weren’t needed"""" but that’s not actually a reference to a direct quote by Scott. We found no statement by Scott to suggest he thought the centers were unnecessary -- only that he thought the new funding wasn’t necessary. The Crist campaign points to a statement by Scott’s spokesman at the time, Lane Wright, who told the Huffington Post, """"This new funding of $1.5 million would have been duplicative, since, as a state, we already fund sexual violence programs. There was no information suggesting any needs in this area weren’t already being met."""" Scott, while attending an event for Crime Victims Rights Week, said he thought the centers were adequately funded, not that they were unnecessary. """"We have increased funding for domestic violence. We have money that goes into rape crisis centers already,"""" Scott said, according to a column in the Palm Beach Post. """"So it was additional money that was already funded."""" Scott later recommended an increase in funding There’s more to the story, though. Advocates for the rape crisis centers met with state staff after the veto, and the next year Scott recommended additional money. """"There were a number of people in the Legislature who spoke with the governor’s office about the need, and in 2013, there it was in his recommended budget,"""" said Jennifer Dritt, director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violent, who spoke with PolitiFact Florida in September. """"We were never in any governor’s recommendation for funding until Gov. Scott recommended $2.5 million in 2013."""" Scott highlighted his funding boost for rape crisis centers in a 2013 press release, which included praise by Dritt: """"This appropriation will make a world of difference in the lives of Florida’s citizens, and we’re grateful for his commitment,"""" Dritt said. The increase in money allowed some centers to hire additional staff which helped reduce waiting lists and expand services, Dritt told PolitiFact Florida. Under Scott, the $2.5 million remained in the budget for a second year in a row in 2014. Based on our interviews with women’s advocates and state officials in September, here is the amount of state dollars that went to rape crisis centers statewide under Crist and Scott: Legislative session Money from state AG (usually from general revenue) Other general revenue Trust Fund Total 2007-Crist $400,000 0 $1.5 million $1.9 million 2008-Crist $400,000 0 $2 million $2.4 million 2009-Crist $250,000 0 $2 million $2.25 million 2010-Crist $250,000 0 $1.8 million $2.05 million 2011-Scott $250,000 0 $1.8 million $2.05 million 2012-Scott $500,000 0 after Scott vetoed $1.5 million approved by Legislature $1.4 million $1.9 million 2013-Scott $500,000 $2.5 million $1.3 million $4.3 million 2014-Scott $500,000 $2.5 million $1.3 million $4.3 million Our ruling A TV ad on behalf of Crist said """"Rick Scott vetoed funding for 30 Florida rape crisis centers.

Social distancing and other measures to slow the virus’s spread are meant to shrink the peak number of cases so hospitals don’t get stretched past their capacity.",Bill McCarthy,"""Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity celebrated the White House’s response to the novel coronavirus in a recent TV monologue, saying the U.S. health care system is ready for the virus. """"We need to prepare for the worst-case scenario,"""" Hannity said on his TV show March 16. """"The president and his task force confirmed they are. Now, as it stands, our health care system has adequate ventilators, ICU beds, medical professionals and ultimately, like I said, we must prepare for the worst, pray for the best."""" That contradicts the warnings of public health experts, who have been sounding alarm about the shortage of ventilators, intensive care unit beds and medical professionals and encouraging Americans to practice social distancing as a way of preventing hospitals from being overrun. Hannity is wrong to say the U.S. has everything it will need, experts said. U.S. hospitals might be able to deal with the number of patients today — although experts we spoke to disagreed on whether that was the case — but the situation will likely look different as it evolves. """"We don’t have nearly enough hospital and ICU beds if there is a surge of cases,"""" said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. """"There is no basis for his assertion."""" """"Even a mild surge of COVID patients will stress our ICUs as they have never been stressed before,"""" added Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. The available data suggests that U.S. hospitals are not as well-equipped as Hannity claimed. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people. That ratio puts the U.S. behind other countries — such as China and Italy — that have struggled to keep up with the spread of COVID-19. That doesn’t bode well for the U.S. response to the coronavirus. As of March 16, Italy has seen more than 24,700 confirmed infections and over 1,800 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Hospitals can’t handle the influx of patients, forcing doctors into difficult decisions. In a March 12 op-ed in the New York Times, health policy experts wrote that if 5% of the country catches COVID-19, there will be enough serious cases to overwhelm the health care system. """"If we follow the curve that Italy has followed, in two to three weeks we will no longer have adequate supplies of any of those necessary resources,"""" Matthew Wynia, director of the Center for Bioethics and Humanities at the University of Colorado, told us. A March 17 analysis from the Harvard Global Health Institute, ProPublica and the New York Times shows how many beds would be filled in parts of the United States if, over the next six, 12 or 18 months, the coronavirus infects 20%, 40% or 60% of the country. The projections show that many U.S. cities won’t have enough hospital beds to meet the number of sick patients in need, assuming the virus continues to spread and nothing is done to increase the hospitals’ capacity. Some states will be worse off than others. In the worst-case scenario — where 60% of the population gets sick within six months — the U.S. would need seven times the number of available hospital beds it currently has, the analysis found. Even in a moderate scenario where 40% is infected over 12 months, many cities such as Washington, D.C., would still need to significantly expand hospital capacity. Jha, who worked on that project, told us its findings show Hannity’s claim to be wrong. The health care system is projected to be overwhelmed by coronavirus patients unless drastic measures are taken. Social distancing and isolation will slow its spread. Here is why that will save lives. pic.twitter.com/R1djQQdpYc Another analysis from USA Today found that """"there could be almost six seriously ill patients for every existing hospital bed"""" — and possibly as many as 17 patients per bed. That examination said the 6-to-1 ratio was a """"conservative"""" estimate based on the assumption that all the hospital beds in the U.S. are currently empty. They’re not. """"Our ICUs are currently stretched thin by flu, and we have shortages of nurses and doctors in many parts of the country,"""" Toner told us. A February report Toner worked on at Johns Hopkins said the U.S. has approximately 46,500 ICU beds in total. If the coronavirus spreads at a moderate pace, then 1 million Americans could be hospitalized and 200,000 Americans would ultimately need an ICU, the report said. A more severe scenario could put up to 9.6 million Americans in the hospital and 2.9 million in need of ICUs. A separate Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security report identified about 160,000 ventilators in the country, though not all are full-featured. That includes tens of thousands of ventilators in hospitals nationwide and thousands more in an emergency federal stockpile. But in 2018, the group estimated that a moderate pandemic similar to the 1957 or 1968 influenza viruses would put about 65,000 people in need of ventilation, and a severe pandemic like the 1918 flu would require ventilators for some 742,500 people. Not all COVID-19 patients will need treatment at the same time, of course. Aaron Carroll, professor at the Indiana School of Medicine, wrote in the New York Times that a key metric is """"the difference between the total number of people who might get sick and the number who might get sick at the same time."""" But states and doctors are worried about shortages. Social distancing, shutdowns and other preventative measures to slow the spread are meant to shrink the peak number of cases so hospitals don’t get stretched past their capacity. Together, we can “flatten the curve” by practicing social distancing, staying home when sick, and washing hands often. This will reduce the strain on our hospitals and emergency rooms, and literally save the lives of our most vulnerable residents. #COVIDー19 #NovelCoronavirus pic.twitter.com/6Yzvg3DONv """"That is why hospitals are cancelling all elective surgeries, planning to expand capacity as much as possible, and even getting ready to make very difficult, battlefield-style triage decisions if it comes to that,"""" Wynia said.

24594,"""AARP is """"endorsing"""" the health care reform bill.""","August 12, 2009",Obama goes too far when he says health reform bills have AARP endorsement,Robert Farley,"""With polls showing seniors are the most skeptical about the health care reform bills working their way through Congress, President Barack Obama sought to ease some of their concerns during a town hall meeting with a little high-powered name-dropping. The name: AARP. Several times at the town hall in Portsmouth, N.H., on Aug. 11, Obama specifically mentioned AARP's support for health care reform. It's little wonder why: The AARP is the country's largest and most powerful advocate for seniors. """"We have the AARP on board because they know this is a good deal for our seniors,"""" Obama said at one point. And later, in response to a question about whether the health care plan would reduce the availability of medications through Medicare, Obama said, """"Well, first of all, another myth that we've been hearing about is this notion that somehow we're going to be cutting your Medicare benefits. We are not. AARP would not be endorsing a bill if it was undermining Medicare, okay?"""" It was that last comment that caught the attention of AARP executives. Not the part that AARP would not support a bill that undermines Medicare benefits. That's true. It was the suggestion that AARP had formally endorsed any particular version of the still-evolving health care plan working its way through Congress. AARP chief operating officer Tom Nelson immediately fired off a press release saying that """"indications that we have endorsed any of the major health care reform bills currently under consideration in Congress are inaccurate."""" The rebuke likely confused a lot of AARP members who have read or heard numerous AARP statements in recent weeks that have supported various aspects of the health care plan. Just a few weeks ago, on July 14, the AARP issued a press release gushing about the introduction of the House health care reform bill saying, """"This bill would make great strides for all of our members and their families."""" The group said it was pleased with the legislation for giving """"every American has access to affordable, quality health care choices."""" Specifically, the release said the bill would make prescription drugs less expensive for seniors, would block insurance companies from denying coverage based on age, and for capping out-of-pocket expenses for some insurance plans. AARP did not explicitly say it was endorsing the bill, but there was not a single negative comment in the statement. In a July 14 ad sponsored by Healthy Economy Now — a coalition including AARP, the American Medical Association and the pharmaceutical industry, among others —  the tone was decidedly upbeat. """"The president and Congress have a plan to lower costs and stop denials for pre-existing conditions,"""" the ad says. """"It's time to act."""" The following day, AARP released a statement about the version of the bill being debated in the Senate. This time, the group was slightly less complimentary; while it said most parts of the legislation were good, AARP remained concerned about a provision in the bill that would prevent some generic drugs from entering the market faster. Since then, the climate in the health care debate has taken a decided nasty turn, with a deep and clear divide between Republicans and Democrats. But AARP spokesman Jim Dau said AARP was not reacting by tempering its stance. He said AARP supports a lot of changes that both the House and Senate bills would make, such as making drugs cheaper for seniors and ending discriminatory practices against the elderly, but the group has been clear all along that it has not endorsed any of the big bills. """"We have endorsed specific measures,"""" Dau said. """"We're praising the pieces that we think are good for members."""" Dau pointed to a statement made by AARP CEO Barry Rand during a July 28 town hall meeting with Obama. """"I want to make it clear that AARP has not endorsed any particular bill, any of the bills that are being circulated around Congress today and debated in Congress today,"""" Rand said. """"We continue to work with the members on both sides of the aisle, and we continue to work with the administration to achieve what is right for health care reform."""" Nelson echoed that bipartisan tone in his statement after Obama's town hall this week. """"AARP has been working with Democrats and Republicans to fix our broken health care system,"""" Nelson stated. """"AARP supports specific measures that would help older Americans and their families – including bipartisan proposals to create a new follow-up care benefit in Medicare that would help prevent hospital readmissions, as well as to address the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap known as the ‘doughnut hole.’ We also support the need for lawmakers and the administration to act this year to fix what doesn’t work in the health care system."""" So was Obama incorrect to say the AARP had endorsed the bill? The July 14 statement sure sounds to us like an endorsement, even if it didn't specifically contain that word. But in Washington, the word """"endorse"""" means you have put the weight of your name behind an official stamp of approval for a bill, candidate or policy. And the fact is, AARP has not formally endorsed any specific bill. It strongly supports some aspects of the bills. But that's not a formal endorsement. And in fact, Obama was present two weeks ago when AARP's CEO said the group """"has not endorsed any particular bill.""""""","https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-at-Town-Hall-on-Health-Insurance-Reform-in-Portsmouth-New-Hampshire/, http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2009/08/11/christian-group-strikes-at-aarp-over-health-care.aspx, http://www.aarp.org/aarp/presscenter/pressrelease/articles/prez_townhall_reaction.html, http://www.aarp.org/aarp/presscenter/pressrelease/articles/HELP_bill_statement.html, http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/08/president-obamas-senior-moment.html, http://www.phrma.org/news_room/press_releases/house_tri-committee_bill_would_hurt_patients_and_kill_jobs/, http://www.gallup.com/poll/121982/seniors-skeptical-healthcare-reform.aspx, http://www.aarp.org/aarp/presscenter/pressrelease/articles/tricomm_health_care_statement.html",false,"National, Health Care, Barack Obama, "
26826,"“(A recent study) said ‘Medicare for All’ will lower health care costs in this country by $450 billion a year and save the lives of 68,000 people who would otherwise have died.”","February 25, 2020","Many of the study's assumptions are flawed, and experts uniformly told us it overestimates the potential savings. It cherry-picks data in calculating mortality effects.",Shefali Luthra,"""UPDATE: This story was updated to include more information about recent studies the Sanders' campaign referenced regarding the costs of single-payer. This update does not change the rating. Defending his signature health plan — a single-payer system known """"Medicare for All"""" that would move all Americans to government-funded coverage — Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders argued that the massive health care expansion would actually save the system hundreds of billions of dollars. Sanders’ figures come from a study published Feb. 15 in The Lancet, a British medical journal. """"It said ‘Medicare for All’ will lower health care costs in this country by $450 billion a year and save the lives of 68,000 people who would otherwise have died,"""" Sanders said at the Feb. 25 Democratic presidential debate. The price tag of Medicare for All has been fiercely debated, and some previous analyses have suggested that the proposal would increase health spending, not decrease it. But Sanders is relying on the Lancet paper — which has a cost estimate that is the lowest, in the neighborhood of $17 trillion over 10 years — to argue that the suite of financing mechanisms he has proposed would more than cover the cost of his health bill. (Funding would include taxes on high earners, a new payroll tax, and 4% income premiums for the majority of families.) Most other estimates place the cost between $30 trillion and $40 trillion over a decade, which would make paying for it far more difficult. So we decided to take a closer look. We reached out to one of the study’s authors, but never heard back. A spokesperson for the Sanders campaign said the paper is """"similar to 22 other recent studies that have also shown that moving to a single-payer healthcare system will cost less than our current dysfunctional healthcare system."""" (We asked for those 22 other studies but, as of publication, hadn’t received them from the campaign. However, an independent researcher provided us with this related analysis.) But other independent experts were skeptical of the Lancet study's estimate — arguing it exaggerates potential savings, cherry-picks evidence and downplays some of the potential tradeoffs. """"I don’t think this study, albeit in a prestigious, peer-reviewed journal, should be given any deference in the Medicare for All debate,"""" said Robert Berenson, a fellow at the Urban Institute who studies hospital pricing. Largely, the Lancet paper is more generous in its assumptions than other Medicare for All analysis, noted Jodi Liu, an economist at the RAND Corp., who studies single-payer plans. To the researchers’ credit, she said, they acknowledge that their findings are based on uncertain assumptions. For instance, the researchers calculate $78.2 billion in savings from providing primary care to uninsured people — $70.4 billion from avoided hospitalizations and $7.8 from avoided emergency room visits. But previous evidence suggests that logic is suspect at best. When states expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, providing new insurance to people who had previously lacked coverage, avoidable hospitalizations and emergency room visits didn’t disappear because people could suddenly use preventive care, noted Ellen Meara, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. That evidence doesn’t appear anywhere in the Lancet paper. """"The notion that we’re going to get rid of all these avoidable visits — that’s not been borne out,"""" she said. The researchers also assume that a Medicare for All system would pay hospitals at a maximum of Medicare rates. That’s tricky. In 2017, the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission estimated that, on average, a hospital has a -9.9% margin on a patient who is insured through Medicare. (Private pay helps make up that difference.) Some hospitals certainly would be able to swallow this cost. But others would struggle to stay afloat, said Adrianna McIntyre, a health policy researcher at Harvard University Given the political influence hospitals in particular carry in Congress — where most members are sensitive to their concerns — passing a plan offering such a low payment rate would be politically challenging. Sanders’ bill doesn’t actually  specify the rates at which hospitals would be paid. Beyond the lower payments, the researchers also suggest hospitals would spend less money on overhead, only having to navigate a single insurance plan. That change accounts for $219 billion in their estimated savings. But again, that ignores some of the reality of how hospitals work. While a single-payer system would undoubtedly cost less to administer — requiring a smaller back-end staff, for instance — it would not eliminate the need for expensive items like electronic health records, which coordinate care between hospitals. """"The assumptions are unrealistic,"""" said Gerard Anderson, a health economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. """"You are never going to save that much money from the various providers."""" Medicare for All would enroll all Americans in coverage far more generous than what most experience now — eliminating virtually all cost-sharing associated with using health care. That’s a major change, researchers told us. Previous evidence suggests that such a shift would encourage consumers to use health care more than they currently do. The Lancet paper acknowledges that — but only partially. It allows that people who are uninsured or """"underinsured"""" — that is, who have particularly high levels of cost-sharing now — would use more medical care under Sanders’ system than they currently do. It factors that into the price tag. But its estimate does not account for people who already have decent or adequate insurance and who would still be moving to a richer benefit, and therefore more likely to use their insurance. """"It drastically underestimates the utilization increases we would expect to see under Medicare for All,"""" McIntyre said. """"People have different views on whether the increased utilization is good or bad,"""" she added — it makes the program more expensive, but also means more people are getting treatment. Context is helpful, too. Other estimates — namely, a projection by the Urban Institute — of Medicare for All have suggested it would increase federal health spending by about $34 trillion over 10 years. But elimination of other health spending would make the overall change smaller. To implement the Sanders proposal, national health spending — public and private dollars, both — would increase by $7 trillion over a decade, Urban said. And Medicare for All would be bringing new services: more insurance for more people, and more generous coverage for those already covered. Urban’s estimate of $7 trillion more in spending over 10 years is far removed from the study’s estimate of $450 billion less annually. And, experts said, relying on the latter figure isn’t a good idea. """"I think they need more work to prove"""" the savings, Meara said. """"They’re not being complete, and by not being complete, they’re not being honest."""" It’s also worth noting that the study’s lead author was also an informal unpaid adviser to the Sanders staff in drafting its 2019 version of the Medicare for All bill, according to the paper’s disclosures section. Experts agree that expanding access to health insurance would probably reduce early mortality. But the 68,000 figure is another example of cherry-picking, Meara said. The figure is based on a 2009 paper. It doesn’t acknowledge a body of research that came after, including multiple studies that examined how expanding Medicaid  affected mortality — and maybe offered less dramatic numbers. """"When they so clearly are cherry-picking, when they clearly have all the  information on studies in front of them, it’s concerning,"""" Meara said. """"It’s a situation where you’re going to overpromise and underdeliver."""" Sanders said a recent study suggested Medicare for All would save $450 billion annually and saves 68,000 lives. That study does exist. And it cites some evidence. But many of its assumptions are flawed, and experts uniformly told us it overestimates the potential savings. It cherry-picks data in calculating mortality effects. This statement has some truth, but ignores context that would create a dramatically different impression.""","https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33019-3/fulltext?eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=2d1a7809-2d05-4592-9985-239cb8ab0884, https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2710505, http://www.medpac.gov/docs/default-source/reports/mar19_medpac_entirereport_sec_rev.pdf?sfvrsn=0, https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-does-bernie-pay-his-major-plans/, http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mille/ACAMortality.pdf",false,"Corrections and Updates, Health Check, Bernie Sanders, "

But the retired pediatric neurosurgeon kept going and prompted another fact-check on the topic when he suggested that there are a """"multitude"""" of vaccines that might not be necessary. """"Vaccines are very important. Certain ones,"""" Carson said. """"The ones that would prevent death or crippling. There are others, there are a multitude of vaccines which probably don't fit in that category, and there should be some discretion in those cases."""" We contacted Carson’s campaign to see what vaccines he meant and his source but did not receive a response. Based on context, in which the candidates were talking about the shots given to children, we decided to look at the vaccines on the childhood schedule supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and our neighbors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC recommends a series of shots to protect children against 15 infectious diseases. They are measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Human papillomavirus (HPV), Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib), polio, influenza (flu), rotavirus, and pneumococcal disease. Most everyone likely knows about measles, the flu and the two types of hepatitis – and that all of those diseases can be deadly. But of the others, are any not lethal or, at the least, not crippling? Hardly. Several experts told us no such disease is prevented by those on the childhood immunization schedule. """"Every one of those can kill or cripple or maim you,"""" said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrics professor at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and one of three inventors of the rotavirus vaccine. And just what is rotavirus? Think of it as a particularly nasty stomach flu – one estimated to have killed 453,000 children under the age of 5 in 2008, most in developing countries, according to the World Health Organization. The others: Mumps – Death is rare, and happens usually in adults. But complications of childhood mumps include deafness and sterility in both genders. Rubella  – A relatively mild virus that usually leads to severe birth defects and blindness and can cause miscarriage and stillbirth in expectant mothers. Chicken pox – Another relatively mild virus that killed 100-150 children annually before vaccines. Diphtheria – Once a major cause of death among U.S. children – including a record 15,520 in 1921 and the terror behind the original Iditarod sled-dog race in Alaska, this powerful disease killed a 6-year-old boy in Spain last year. Tetanus – This bacteria kills up to 20 percent of those infected, with many suffering from spasms severe enough to break bones. Whooping cough – A brutal disease that killed 20 in 2012, including 15 infants too young for the vaccine. The World Health Organization estimates it caused 89,000 deaths worldwide in 2012. HPV – The more controversial of all vaccines, largely because it prevents a sexually transmitted virus that can cause several types of cancer which can be deadly, even with treatment. HiB – A bacteria that can cause several invasive diseases, including meningitis, which that killed about 1,000 American children annually before vaccines. In 2008, it killed an estimated 199,000 children worldwide. Pneumococcal disease – One of the leading causes of illness in children that kills about 5 percent of those infected and leaves some survivors with permanent injury. """"I would bet that any single one of these vaccines have saved more children than the number of lives Ben Carson has saved as a neurosurgeon,"""" said Dr. Adam Lauring, a professor at the University of Michigan medical school who specializes in infectious diseases. """"Because we don’t see many of these diseases anymore, they are almost perceived as inconveniences,"""" Lauring continued. """"But fact is, people do die of these diseases and we have forgotten that because we haven’t seen them."""" When they do appear, such as with last year’s measles outbreak, they are far less lethal disease than in year’s past.

The ballot initiative would have no formal effect on prices for the privately insured, and the trickle-down effect for market prices remains speculative.""",Manuela Tobias,"""Ohio Taxpayers for Lower Drug Prices claims its ballot initiative could lower the price tag for the EpiPen, a popular auto-injector for serious allergic reactions. """"We’ve gone from paying about $100 for EpiPens to over $600. And they only hold about one dollar’s worth of medicine,"""" the Aug. 29, 2017, video says. """"We don’t have a choice but to pay it and the drug companies know it. Vote yes on Issue 2, the Drug Price Relief Act."""" Do EpiPens really cost that much, and could their price go down with an up-vote on the ballot initiative? Prescription drugs may be severely overpriced, but the ad misrepresents the bill’s impact. And strangely, its example of EpiPens doesn’t really apply to the population that the group is trying to help. Issue 2 is a ballot initiative up for a vote on Nov. 7. If approved, it would require all drugs bought by the state -- whether for Medicaid or other state programs -- to match Veterans Affairs prices, which receive a 24 percent discount off market price in addition to sometimes undisclosed rebates. The idea is that it would lower the state’s health care costs. The ad has a point that the price for the EpiPen two-pack soared since 2007, from $94 to $609. Each pen holds about one dollar’s worth of the drug epinephrine. While the ad makes it sound as though there is no alternative, Mylan released a $300 generic EpiPen two-pack in December 2016 and Lineage Therapeutics offers a generic auto-injector for $110. That’s still a lot, but it’s less than the $600 the ad mentions. The ad also misrepresents the population the initiative would aid, as approximately 70 percent of EpiPen users are privately insured, and Medicaid patients already pay nothing out of pocket, according to Brittany Warner, an Ohio Medicaid spokeswoman. And even if the ad was referring to the prices paid by the state, instead of patients, Medicaid already enjoys significant discounts. Brand EpiPen 2-pak’s listed price for the Medicaid program is $291.41, but because it doesn’t include rebates (which remain confidential), it may be lower. The VA price is indeed lower: $182.33, which includes rebates. """"They’re trying to appeal to the sense of outrage of high drug prices, especially for things that ought to be covered for free, but it’s a weird example to cite in the context of this particular initiative, as the vast majority of people who use it are privately insured,"""" said Kao-Ping Chua, a health policy researcher at the University of Chicago who co-authored a study of out-of-pocket spending on EpiPens. Chua said the privately insured and the uninsured bore the greatest brunt of the price increase, though the price they faced for the injectors varied depending on the type of plan they are on. According to Julie Knell, a spokeswoman for Mylan, the company that sells EpiPens, """"nearly 90 percent of consumers who received EpiPen Auto-Injector or its authorized generic had an out-of-pocket cost of less than $100 and more than 80 percent are paying less than $50."""" """"I would still argue that $100 is a lot to pay for a life-saving medication,"""" Chua said. """"This is the difference between life and death."""" In addition to the Medicaid program, the state purchases drugs for state employees, prisons, and other state-run programs, but the campaign was unable to pin down the effect of the initiative on these groups. Dennis Willard, a campaign spokesman, said 4 million Ohioans would be affected, 2.8 million of whom are on Medicaid or CHIP. Rachel Sachs, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, told us that if the initiative worked (she identified various legal issues with it in a blog post), the biggest impact would be felt by state correctional systems, which go unmentioned in the ad. Chua warned that if lowering the price for the privately insured was the goal of Issue 2, this wasn’t the best way forward, as companies could raise costs for private insurers to make up for lost revenue from states like Ohio. Opposition ads make a similar argument, claiming VA prices could also increase in response to the act. Researchers Thomas J. Hwang and Aaron S. Kesselheim evaluated this question when the group proposed a similar initiative in California. (It didn’t pass.) They said that the long-term budgetary effect of the ballot initiative was uncertain. A review claiming causation between a similar 1990 measure and increased VA prices couldn’t be """"credibly established,"""" they said. Sachs said that restricting the price pharmaceutical companies can demand from the state of Ohio shouldn’t affect the price they offer private insurers or the VA. That’s because price discrimination makes it so that pharmaceuticals arrange different prices with each market, and there’s no reason to believe they haven’t already struck the best deal possible in each one. While studies suggest cost-shifting, or the displacement of costs on other markets, has little impact on hospitals, Sachs admits there’s insufficient research on this phenomenon in the pharmaceutical industry. In the absence of research on the impact of similar initiatives elsewhere, Gerard Anderson, a professor at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it would be difficult to gauge the proposal’s impact on the privately insured. A pro-Issue 2 ad in Ohio claimed, """"We’ve gone from paying about $100 for Epipens to over $600. And they only hold about one dollar’s worth of medicine. We don’t have a choice but to pay it and the drug companies know it."""" There is a key difference in the """"we"""" paying $600 -- a relatively small fraction of the privately insured population -- and the population for whom the initiative plans to lower prices. The majority of those covered by state-sponsored insurance, like Medicaid, already pay a $0 co-pay. The campaign didn’t provide evidence of the impact on other state-insured populations, though it could have a significant impact on the smaller prison population, which does not face the same rebates as the Medicaid program. The ballot initiative would have no formal effect on prices for the privately insured, and the trickle-down effect for market prices remains speculative.""","http://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/total-monthly-medicaid-and-chip-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D, http://www.voryshcadvisors.com/files/2016/09/2016-9-27-Report-OH-Drug-Price-Initiated-Statute.pdf, https://druglookup.ohgov.changehealthcare.com/DrugSearch/application/search?searchBy=name&name=epipen, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-Bw7gSfDM0, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3160596/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/27/why-epipens-expire-so-quickly/?utm_term=.73e9a0ff22fd, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-23/how-marketing-turned-the-epipen-into-a-billion-dollar-business, https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2612114, http://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i5657, http://yesonissue2.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Embargoed-Final-Report-8.23-1.pdf, http://www.deceptiverxissue.org/, https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/medicaid-drug-rebate-program/index.html, https://www.wsj.com/articles/mylan-faces-scrutiny-over-epipen-price-increases-1472074823, https://www.va.gov/oal/business/fss/pharmPrices.asp, http://yesonissue2.com/",false,"Ohio, Health Care, Ohio Taxpayers for Lower Drug Prices, "
22608,"""The federal health care law is """"probably the biggest tax increase ever in the history of our country.""","February 14, 2011",Rick Scott says health care law is biggest tax increase in U.S. history,Aaron Sharockman,"""Florida Gov. Rick Scott's new job isn't getting in the way of his old hobby -- criticizing the federal health care law. Scott, who in 2009 formed Conservatives for Patients' Rights to oppose health care reforms being proposed by President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress, has continued to fight the health care reforms from his new perch as governor of Florida. The multimillionaire former hospital chain CEO promises to support lawsuits seeking to declare the law unconstitutional, and on Feb. 3, 2011, called on Obama to repeal the tax provisions of the health care law. In a speech to tout the release of his first state budget, Scott challenged Obama to repeal or roll back taxes and fees increased to help pay for the increased coverage the health care seeks to provide. Scott said Obama should follow Florida's lead -- where Scott was planning to cut state school property taxes and the corporate income tax. The federal health care law is """"a massive tax increase, probably the biggest tax increase ever in the history of our country,"""" Scott told about 100 Chromalloy employees during a tour of their aerospace manufacturing plant in Tampa. """"Those tax increases, they are taking money out of your pocket. They are taking money out of your company's pocket. They are taxing things that you buy. All that is taking money out of our economy and throwing more money at the federal government, which makes no sense."""" Scott spent more than a year fighting the passage of the health care bill, so he certainly knows the legislation. But does he have the line right about being the """"biggest tax increase ever?"""" The health care law certainly is, on the whole, a tax increase. Major tax provisions The federal Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants, provided members a detailed breakdown of tax impact from 2010-2019. • Starting in 2013, Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points for people with incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. The 10-year cost: $210.2 billion. • Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called """"Cadillac plans"""" (over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families), kicks in. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. • Starting in 2011, there's a new fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers. That's expected to raise $27 billion over 10 years. • Starting in 2013, a 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices starts. The 10-year total: $20 billion. • Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers begins. Total estimated 10-year revenue: $60.1 billion. • Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's expected to bring in $15.2 billion over the next 10 years. • Starting in 2011, a 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. That's expected to bring in $2.7 billion over the next 10 years. There also is money in the law going the other way. The plan includes government money, in the form of tax credits, to subsidize the cost of health insurance for lower-income people who don't get insurance through their employer. For the record, many Republicans and tax experts argue those shouldn't count as tax cuts. And there is a tax cut for some very small businesses that allows them to write off a portion of the cost of providing insurance to their employees. Combined with various other revenue-generating provisions, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the health law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019. The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the additional revenues coming in to the government to be $525 billion between now and 2019. Does that translate to the biggest tax increase in American history? Comparing tax impacts of legislation  First, we need to set some goal posts. There are many ways to define or measure the size of a tax increase, and not all tax increases have been measured the same way over time. The health care tax provisions, for instance, take effect between 2011 and 2018, meaning the full effect of the legislation won't be felt until near the end of the decade. On top of that, it doesn't make sense to compare 2019 dollars to 1985 dollars. You have to adjust for inflation, or express the amount as a total of Gross Domestic Product at the time, which is a way to measure the relative impact of a tax provision at the time it was enacted. To make matters even more complicated, there are tax cuts that are direct results of tax increases, and vice-versa. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), for example, was passed largely to reverse revenue losses from the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA). For our comparison, we used a method perfected by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 2006, Tempalski tried to determine the relative impact of major tax revenue bills from 1940-2006. He used revenue estimates from Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation and calculated the impact as a percentage of GDP. For 1940-1967 calculations, he used a single-year snapshot of the revenue impact of the tax legislation. For more recent tax bills, from 1968-2006, Tempalski used a two-year average of the revenue effects. Tempalski wrote: """"The comparison of tax bills for the first period should be examined with some caution, because the revenue estimates are from different sources and are not completely consistent. The comparison for the second period can be viewed with more confidence, because the estimates are relatively consistent."""" As a percent of GDP, here are the top five tax increases from 1940-2006, according to Tempalski:  1. Revenue Act of 1942: 5.04 percent of GDP;  2. Revenue Act of 1961: 2.2 percent of GDP;  3. Current Tax Payment Act of 1943: 1.13 percent of GDP;  4. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP;  5. Excess Profits Tax of 1950: .97 percent of GDP;  And here are the top five tax increases from the """"modern"""" era of 1968-2006:  1. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP;  2. Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982: .8 percent of GDP;  3(t): Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980: .5 percent of GDP  3(t): Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993; .5 percent of GDP;  5: Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990; .49 percent of GDP. The 2010 health care law  The list obviously does not include the health care law, which passed in 2010, and a spokeswoman for the Department of Treasury says it hasn't been updated. So we calculated our own percent of GDP figure. We used 2019 as our baseline because that's when all of the tax provisions of the law will be in effect. In 2019, the CBO estimates, the government will see increased revenues of $104 billion. We then divided that number into the projected GDP for 2019, which according to the CBO economic forecast is $21.164 trillion. That would mean the tax increase provisions of the health care law would amount to .49 percent of total GDP. Depending on your rounding, that would mean the tax increases resulting from the health care law would be about the size of tax cuts proposed and passed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush and in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. The health care-related tax increases are smaller than the tax increase signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1982 and a temporary tax signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. And they are significantly smaller than two tax increases passed during World War II and a tax increase passed in 1961. The tax increases in the health care legislation do reverse a trend of federal tax cuts and represents the first significant tax increases since 1993. But for Scott to suggest they are the largest in U.S. history is inaccurate.""","http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/tax-analysis/Documents/ota81.pdf, https://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/114xx/doc11439/WHCC_Presentation-4-12-10.pdf, http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=3672",false,"Health Care, Taxes, Florida, Rick Scott, "

I've tried everything,"""" the doctor says. """"But doctor, I've already waited over six months,'' says the patient. """"I can't bear this any longer.

""""The depressed old man's gaze averts downward -- perhaps a hint that he realizes he will die?Will the new health care bill approved by Congress translate to denying treatment to sweet old men like the one featured in the video? Will somber-faced doctors be telling grandpa that he is too old for treatment? We had to check this out. First we contacted Fanelli, who said he posted the video on his website in late March. We asked if he could point us to any documentation -- such as a section of the bill, a position paper from an organization -- to support his conclusion about age limits. The simple answer: no. """"You are asking for substantiation. I can't go to a page in the bill but what I can tell you is the country is over $13 trillion in debt. ... The medical program increases the number of recipients substantially. When you increase the number dramatically ... where is the money going to come from? It is obvious it's going to have to be only certain people are going to get certain coverages. ... The commercial is to show what is going on in other countries with socialized medicine. You can't add more services when you don't have enough money to pay the government bills currently, and that's what we've done. """"Fanelli said he has his own family experience to draw his conclusions. """"My aunt lives in France and had been denied for a procedure,"""" to get a pacemaker, he said. """"The reason she was denied was because she was too old. Common sense tells me when you increase the number of people covered, and you don't have enough money to go around ... there's eventually going to come to point where we say what can we afford, what we can't afford."""" Ultimately his French aunt was able to get the procedure, according to Fanelli.Fanelli said the video """"is a metaphor for what is used in England where they use age to determine what services people are going to get. """"Our friends at FactCheck.org researched a question about age limits and health care in England in July 2009. The article quoted a nonprofit in England, Age Concern and Help the Aged, that ageism does occur -- for example a doctor refusing to refer an elderly patient to a consultant. But the nonprofit also stated that a national organization was created to improve health care for the elderly and one of its standards was """"rooting out age discrimination. """"Steve Ullmann, professor and director of Programs in Health Sector Management and Policy at the University of Miami, said """"there is some limitation in provisions of care of people based on age in England,"""" for certain treatments though """"you can buy them out of pocket outside of the National Health Service. """"Back to health care in the United States. We asked specifically if Fanelli had found an age-limit in the health care bill. """"I have tried to look at that bill and it's a masterful mess,'' said the 54-year-old retired airline captain and Navy reserves retiree. When we asked about whether Fanelli had read about an age cutoff in news articles, he replied: """"I have been at lectures."""" He heard one from a brain surgeon. """"I don't remember the name. I wasn't anticipating getting a phone interview on this."""" We contacted him again the next day to clarify if he had read any news articles about an age limit and he said: """"There are various articles. I can't quote verse, page and date. ... We arrived at the claim because there is not enough money generated in tax revenue to pay for the current expenses for the U.S. government and this is going to be an additional expense. """"Among Fanelli's claimed sources is his wife's dermatologist, Dr. John Meisenheimer of Orlando. He said the doctor saved his wife's life when she had skin cancer. Meisenheimer also is the doctor starring in Fanelli's video. """"Meisenheimer has discussed they are going to be picking and choosing,"""" Fanelli said. """"It is generally accepted by medical health professionals there will only be limited amount of money. Most people believe it will be younger people as opposed to older people. """"We called Meisenheimer, a board-certified dermatologist for more than 20 years, to get his explanation of the video. """"The ad is a metaphor for ageism,"""" Meisenheimer said. """"This isn't about 'death panels.' Death panels do not exist. """"(PolitiFact agrees with Meisenheimer about death panels. That was a claim made by Sarah Palin in August 2009 that we rated . )But the health care bill makes cuts to Medicare, he said, and that will lead to less care for the elderly. """"It can be a very slippery slope. It's not going to happen like in the commercial,'' said Meisenheimer, whose office website states that he accepts Medicare patients. """"Doctors will have to make a decision: where is the best use of money? Do I use it for a 95-year-old who has skin cancer or for somebody younger? ... There is not enough money there in the can for everybody."""" The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Medicare provisions are estimated to result in a net reduction of $428 billion between 2010 and 2019. It also states that the bill supports """"comparative effectiveness research"""" to compare the clinical effectiveness of treatments, but that the findings """"may not be construed as mandates, guidelines, or recommendations for payment, coverage, or treatment or used to deny coverage."""" So that seems to say that even if research shows a certain treatment for the elderly isn't effective, that can't be used to create an age limit for that treatment.We also contacted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which oversees Medicare. Spokesman Peter Ashkenaz told us in an e-mail that there are no age limits for treatment under Medicare. """"There are no eligibility changes to Medicare in the new law,"""" he wrote.Fanelli said his video hasn't aired on television, though it's on his campaign website and on YouTube. We sent links to Fanelli's video to experts on the health care bill: Ullmann at the University of Miami; Alwyn Cassil, director of public affairs for the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan research organization; and Len Nichols, Director for the Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics at George Mason University. All three said there is nothing in the bill that would cut off treatment based on an age limit.The video """"has no basis in reality whatsoever,"""" Cassil said. """"There is nothing in that bill that I am aware of, or certainly every reporter who has combed every inch of it that mentions anything about 'age limits.' '' So to recap, Fanelli's ad offers a dramatic scene that has no solid facts behind it. He claims it portrays """"Obamacare,"""" but he cannot cite any provisions in the health care bill -- other than vague fear of a European system -- that could cause such a tragic scene.

""""I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic."""" Trump re-emphasized that point in a tweet the next morning.

I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the “borders” from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false! Trump and his administration acted to keep the virus out of the United States, but his words in public downplayed the threat for many weeks. On Jan. 20, about three weeks after China first reported the new virus, the World Health Organization reported cases in China, Japan, Thailand and South Korea. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention activated its emergency response center on Jan. 21. On Jan. 29, the White House formed the Coronavirus Task Force, headed by Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and coordinated by the National Security Council. On Jan. 30, Trump effectively banned all non-Americans from entering the country if they had been in China in the previous two weeks. Americans could come back, but they would be quarantined. Azar declared a public health emergency. The same day, WHO declared a global health emergency. It was the fifth time WHO issued such a warning since 2005. Fears of a pandemic were in the air by mid January. The federal response came as Trump painted a more comforting picture. On Jan. 22, in an interview with CNBC, Trump was asked, """"Are there worries about a pandemic at this point?"""" """"No,"""" Trump replied. """"Not at all. We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine."""" Two days later, he gave the sense that the virus would be kept in China. """"China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,"""" Trump tweeted Jan. 24. """"The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well."""" China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! Trump maintained that upbeat tone at a Jan. 30 rally in Iowa. """"We think we have it very well under control,"""" he said. """"We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five. And those people are all recuperating successfully."""" In a Feb. 2 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump repeated the idea that transmission was unlikely. """"We pretty much shut it down coming in from China,"""" he said. """"We’re going to see what happens, but we did shut it down."""" Trump also suggested that warmer weather in April would beat back the virus. As late as Feb. 24 and Feb. 25, Trump continued to paint a picture of a virus corralled. He tweeted that the virus was """"very much under control in the USA,"""" and added """"Stock Market starting to look very good to me!"""" In India, he said """"we have very few people with it,"""" and they were getting better. This was at a time when WHO had reported 76,000 cases worldwide. A pandemic is when a new disease spreads worldwide. On March 11, WHO formally declared the coronavirus to be a pandemic. Trump said that he’s """"always known this is a real, this is a pandemic. I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic."""" Until late February, Trump spoke as though the U.S. problem was limited and well under control.

24708,"""The economic stimulus bill created a council that's """"modeled after the national board that controls Britain’s health system.""","May 11, 2009",Health board in the stimulus bill not meant to imitate Britain,Angie Drobnic Holan,"""A television ad makes the argument that the United States is on the path to a nationalized health service similar to the United Kingdom's. The advocacy group Conservatives for Patients' Rights created the ad, which features the group's chairman, Rick Scott, talking about the economic stimulus bill that became law Feb. 17, 2009. Scott is a health care executive who founded Solantic, a chain of urgent care clinics in Florida. """"Deep inside the stimulus bill Congress buried an innocent-sounding board, the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research,"""" Scott says in the ad. """"It's not so innocent. It's the first step in government control over your health care choices. This federal council is modeled after the national board that controls Britain's health system."""" The ad goes on to quote doctors who complain about lack of choice and long waiting times for care in the national health care systems of Britain and Canada. """"Not only could a government board deny your choice in doctors but it can control life and death for some patients,"""" Scott says. """"Tell Congress you won't trade your doctor for a national board of bureaucrats. Let's put patients first,"""" he concludes. The ad is correct that the stimulus bill includes language creating the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research. But to say it's modeled after the British health system is wrong. The board is simply an effort to pull together disparate federal agencies to find the best health treatments. Comparative effectiveness research is an effort in health care to determine which treatments work best. The new board's goal, according to the bill's conference report, is to """"reduce duplication of comparative effectiveness research activities within the federal government."""" The legislation requires that half of the board's 15 members be physicians or """"other experts with clinical expertise."""" The legislation also specifically states it does not permit the board to """"mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer"""" and that the none of the board's reports or recommendations """"shall be construed as mandates or clinical guidelines for payment, coverage, or treatment."""" This stands in sharp contrast to the British system, where government entities run the health care system and a national board, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Evidence, determines whether particular treatments are covered or not. In defending its ad, the group has said that its ad makes clear that the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research is simply a """"first step"""" toward the British system. But that seems to be the group's opinion more than a fact. There are relatively few supporters for a government-run health care system in Congress, though Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, both Democrats, support similar models known as single-payer health systems. President Barack Obama has specifically rejected a government-run health care system in the style of Britain or Canada, even though some of his supporters have asked him to consider it as an option. He addressed the matter most directly during a town hall on March 26, 2009, where people submitted questions via the Internet, including, """"Why can we not have a universal health care system, like many European countries, where people are treated based on needs rather than financial resources?"""" Obama said that the British and Canadian systems are too different from what exists in the United States, where the majority of people get health care coverage through their employers. (Read his extended answer via  the White House transcript  .) """"I don't think the best way to fix our health care system is to suddenly completely scrap what everybody is accustomed to and the vast majority of people already have. Rather, what I think we should do is to build on the system that we have and fill some of these gaps,"""" he concluded. He also added that he hoped to """"lower costs through reforms in how we reimburse doctors so that they're not getting paid just for the number of operations they're doing, but for whether they're quality outcomes."""" That seems how a board like the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research would make an impact under Obama's plan. We can't say for sure, though, because Obama and Congress have yet to reveal the full details of health care reform. This is not to say that implementing comparative effectiveness research will be painless for the public, and Obama has admitted as much. In an interview with the  New York Times  on April 14, 2009, he discussed his grandmother's decision to get a hip replacement even though she had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and died soon after the replacement. """"I would have paid out of pocket for that hip replacement just because she’s my grandmother,"""" Obama said. """"Whether, sort of in the aggregate, society making those decisions to give my grandmother, or everybody else’s aging grandparents or parents, a hip replacement when they’re terminally ill is a sustainable model, is a very difficult question."""" Obama added that answering tough questions on end-of-life care will """"have to be a conversation that is guided by doctors, scientists, ethicists. And then there is going to have to be a very difficult democratic conversation that takes place. It is very difficult to imagine the country making those decisions just through the normal political channels. And that’s part of why you have to have some independent group that can give you guidance. It’s not determinative, but I think has to be able to give you some guidance."""" Getting back to the ad: It is right that the economic stimulus bill created the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research. But the ad is wrong that it is """"modeled after the national board that controls Britain’s health system."""" We see no evidence for that. In fact, the president has specifically rejected the British model, while praising comparative effectiveness research as an acceptable way to rein in spending. Because the ad significantly distorts the reason for the board's existence.""","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCNO_y-NnVk, https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/10/AR2009051002243.html?sid=ST2009051002328, https://www.factcheck.org/politics/government-run_health_care.html, http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h1enr.pdf, http://www.nice.org.uk/aboutnice/whatwedo/what_we_do.jsp?domedia=1&mid=EE5AA72F-19B9-E0B5-D4215C860E77FD2E, http://cprights.org/about.php, https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-at-Open-for-Questions-Town-Hall/, https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/magazine/03Obama-t.html, https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/world/europe/21britain.htm, http://www.cprights.org/2009/05/who-fact-checks-factcheckorg.php, http://www.house.gov/billtext/hr1_cr_jes.pdf",false,"National, Health Care, Stimulus, Conservatives for Patients' Rights, "
17610,Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate.,"December 11, 2013","""Limbaugh said, """"Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate."""" There is concern about a """"marriage penalty,"""" which exists for other federal programs with sliding income eligibility scales, with the Affordable Care Act, and there is anecdotal evidence that at least one couple considered divorce to avoid it. (The postscript: She got a new full-time job and can afford insurance on the exchange, so they’re still married.) But there is no research that suggests this will substantially affect the country’s divorce rate, which is a little hard to measure in the first place. Experts said the effect may be marginal, as no one has done the research to nail down reasonable expectations.""",Katie Sanders,"""If you think divorce is prevalent now, just wait. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh says marriage in the United States is poised to crumble for a whole new reason. Yes, the culprit is Obamacare. The point came up as Limbaugh chatted with a caller from Jacksonville, Fla., on his Dec. 6, 2013, talk show. Jim the caller: """"Greetings, Rush. My concern is about unintended social consequences of the Obama No Care Act. Think about it. There's supplements for having a lower income. ... Will there be an incentive not to be married or to get divorced? You'll get incentives on the Obamacare side."""" Limbaugh: """"You know, you are very shrewd, Jim, because there is a story we had, it might have been late last week, that people are divorcing in order to afford Obamacare. It is busting up families. Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate."""" We decided to fact-check Limbaugh’s claim that """"Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate."""" A month-old anecdote The news story Limbaugh referenced was about a New York couple considering a divorce so they could qualify for subsidies individually to offset the cost of health care under the new law. The story did not address Limbaugh’s claim that the health care law will increase the country’s divorce rate, leading us to wonder if there is credible research to support his assertion. The early verdict: Experts say there is no evidence or research that suggests the health care law will grow the divorce rate. But the law does contain a """"marriage penalty,"""" which essentially means unmarried couples could pay less for health insurance because they have separate, smaller incomes than married couples whose combined income exceeds the cut-off for federal financial assistance. And at least one couple considered divorce to avoid increased health care costs. Emphasis on """"considered."""" The Atlantic spotlighted one married couple to illustrate the """"marriage penalty"""" disparity, and a CBS affiliate in New York picked up the story the next day. Writer Nona Willis Aronowitz told the magazine she got married in 2009 so her freelance filmmaker-husband Aaron Cassara could receive health insurance through her employer. But her job ended when her employer laid off her editorial division. The layoff left her with a COBRA plan that was more expensive but allowed her to maintain temporary health coverage at a group rate. Faced with a Jan. 1 end date for that coverage, which did not extend to her husband because it cost too much, she checked out her options on the New York health insurance exchange set up under the health care law. She and her husband earned more than 400 percent of the 2012 federal poverty level, or $62,040 for a family of two, which made them ineligible for premium assistance. Under the law, people whose family income is between 100 and 400 percent of federal poverty are eligible for premium support. However, had they not been married and sought health insurance on their own, their individual incomes would have qualified for them for subsidies because they would have been under the cut-off income for one person, or $45,980. """"In our case, it would be worth it,"""" Aronowitz said of getting divorced to CBS2. """"In other people’s cases, where marriage is really, really important to them and they had a big wedding and it was this sacred experience, I think it would be a really tough decision for them."""" We reached out to Aronowitz to find out what’s happened in the month since word of her story broke. Aronowitz told PunditFact she recently obtained a full-time job and can now afford health insurance for her and her husband in 2014 on the state exchange. The couple, therefore, is not seeking a divorce. Broader impact? The health care law is not the first government program to have a """"marriage tax"""" issue. It also comes up under current U.S. income tax law and for programs such as food stamps, temporary cash assistance and others. Whenever eligibility for a program depends on a sliding-scale subsidy based on income and family size, there is the potential for """"encouraging"""" couples to marry or not marry, said Gail Wilensky, director of Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush. Teasing out the effect of the Affordable Care Act marriage penalty on divorce rates would not be easy. """"My guess is that at the most, this kind of effect is more annoying than impactful. You would have to be pretty indifferent as to whether you married or didn’t marry to have tax or subsidy consequences determine your decision,"""" Wilensky said. """"But small is not the same as none."""" In the case of health insurance, marriage actually also brings benefits. Married couples have more access to insurance, as many large employers offer family plans that extend to an employee’s married spouse and dependents. That’s why Aronowitz said she and her husband got married in the first place. According to an October 2013 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the percentage of uninsured married adults is about 15 percent of the population, compared to 33 percent for single adults living together. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said married couples are most affected by the """"marriage penalty"""" when two things happen: Neither person is eligible for affordable health insurance under an employer's plan, and the couple is eligible for a more sizable government insurance subsidy as two unmarried adults rather than as a married couple. But the law also contains some """"marriage bonuses,"""" similar to U.S. tax law, he said. Some companies will feel compelled to offer health insurance to their employees so they do not face tax penalties. Many will offer family insurance plans, which would be enticing for the married spouse of an employee, Burtless said. """"I’m sure we’ll hear anecdotes over the next few months and years, and I’m sure some of the anecdotes will be described in occasional press stories,"""" Burtless said. """"But it will be many years, if ever, before a careful examination of the evidence shows whether the ‘marriage penalty’ in the ACA has a bigger impact discouraging marriage or encouraging divorce than the ‘marriage bonus’ in the ACA has in encouraging marriage or discouraging divorce."""" Limbaugh’s statement is """"pure conjecture"""" at this point, said Andrew Cherlin, a professor of public policy and sociology at Johns Hopkins University. """"It could also have a positive effect on marriage, as it lowers health insurance premiums for low-income couples (who have a higher divorce rate) and as it makes people healthier, which could increase their earnings,"""" Cherlin said. """"We don't know what the balance will be."""" Divorce statistics are a whole other matter. The country does not keep comprehensive data. One measure is the rate of divorce per 1,000 population. The divorce rate was 3.6 divorces per 1,000 population in 2011, according to rough numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, those CDC statistics are imperfect because several states do not report divorce and annulment data to the feds, including the most populous state of California. Divorce has been on the decline since 1980, said Brad Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia. Marriage has become more selective, and more couples are living together without getting married. Couples who are better educated and more affluent are more likely to get married and are less likely to divorce, he said. """"So if Obamacare exacts a major marriage penalty on couples, it may increase divorce at the margins,"""" he said. The oft-repeated stat that 50 percent of marriages end in divorce is essentially true for the overall population, but the odds decline when factors such as college education, religious affiliation, home life and marrying at a later age are considered, according to a 2012 report by the National Marriage Project and the Center for Marriage and Families at the Institute for American Values. An October 2013 report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found the likelihood of a marriage ending in divorce a bit lower, between 40-45 percent. We emailed Limbaugh's show but did not hear back. Our ruling Limbaugh said, """"Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate."""" There is concern about a """"marriage penalty,"""" which exists for other federal programs with sliding income eligibility scales, with the Affordable Care Act, and there is anecdotal evidence that at least one couple considered divorce to avoid it. (The postscript: She got a new full-time job and can afford insurance on the exchange, so they’re still married.)

38906, An undercover Planned Parenthood video claims that the group sells fetal body parts from partial birth abortions for profit. ,"July 23, 2015",Planned Parenthood Sells Body Parts for Profit ,  Rich Buhler & Staff  ,"An undercover Planned Parenthood video that claims the group sells body parts from abortions for profit has been disputed. Planned Parenthood said patients who seek abortions can elect to “donate tissue to scientific research.” But the organization disputes that it, or its patients, profits from those donations. The controversy started when and anti-abortion group called the Center for Medical Progress posted an undercover video on YouTube. The video reportedly showed Dr. Deborah Nucatola, the senior director of medical services at Planned Parenthood, discussing the sale of fetal tissue and body parts with so-called “potential buyers.” One excerpt from the video — which had nearly 2 million views within days of being posted — captures a conversation between Nucatola and the two people posing as buyers over lunch: Nucatola: Every provider has had patients who want to donate their tissue, and they absolutely want to accommodate them. The just want to do it in a way that is not perceived as, “this clinic is selling tissue, this clinic is making money off of this.” Buyers: Okay, so, when you are, or the affiliate is, determining what that monetary… Nucatola: Yes Buyers: So that it doesn’t raise any question of this is what it’s about, this is the main — what price range would … Nucatola: You know, I would throw a number out, I would say it’s probably anywhere from $30 to $100, depending on the facility and what’s involved. Planned Parenthood responded with a statement that said it follows all state and federal laws related to tissue donations, and that it does not profit from them: In health care, patients sometimes want to donate tissue to scientific research that can help lead to medical breakthroughs, such as treatments and cures for serious diseases. Women at Planned Parenthood who have abortions are no different. At several of our health centers, we help patients who want to donate tissue for scientific research, and we do this just like every other high-quality health care provider does — with full, appropriate consent from patients and under the highest ethical and legal standards. There is no financial benefit for tissue donation for either the patient or for Planned Parenthood. In some instances, actual costs, such as the cost to transport tissue to leading research centers, are reimbursed, which is standard across the medical field. The Center for Medical Progress responded that Planned Parenthood had made “key admissions” in its response: Planned Parenthood makes two key admissions in their statement today: 1) aborted fetal parts are harvested at their clinics, and 2) money is exchanged in connection with this. They also tell several lies: 1) That proper consent is obtained from patients, 2) That Planned Parenthood does not make money off the body parts, and 3) that everything is legal. The Center for Medical Progress also released a flier from StemExpress, a California-based biomedical company that (the video claims) purchases fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood. The flier discusses the possibility of financial gain for clinics: StemExpress promotes global biomedical research while also providing a financial benefit to your clinic. By partnering with StemExpress, not only are you offering a way for your clients to participate in the unique opportunity to facilities life-saving research, but you will also be contributing to the fiscal growth of your own clinic. The stem cell rich blood and raw materials that are usually discarded during obstetrical procedures can, instead, be expedited through StemExpress to research laboratories with complete professionalism and source anonymity. Nucatola referenced conversations with StemExpress in the video, but she implied that there wasn’t an agreement between the groups in place at the time. Then, in a prepared statement to The Hill, Planned Parenthood said Nucatola was not discussing the sale of body parts and that reimbursements for donated tissue costs were not uncommon: “Deborah Nucatela was speculating on the range of reimbursement that patients can receive after stating they wish to donate any tissue after a procedure,” the organization wrote in a report prepared by its PR firm. “The promotional video mischaracterizing Planned Parenthood’s mission and services is made by a long time anti-abortion activist that has used deceptive and unethical video editing, and that has created a fake medical website as well as a fake human tissue website that purports to provide services to stem cell researchers,” the group wrote in a two-page statement. It also provided several pages of background research about the organization’s use of donated fetal tissue, which it describes as “humanitarian undertaking that hold the potential to cure disease, save lives, and ameliorate suffering.” Planned Parenthood and other critics of the undercover video have argued that it was a carefully edited attack by an anti-abortion group. The Center for Medical Progress (not the same as the Center for Medical Progress at the Manhattan Institute) has a minimal online footprint, so little is known about the group. But David Daleiden, the group’s self-identified founder, has been a long time anti-abortion activist. In 2009, Daleiden posted another video in which he suggested during a Q&A session that Planned Parenthood had “an institutional tolerance for adult-child sexual relationships,” the Daily Beast reports. So, it’s true that Planned Parenthood donates fetal tissue to medical research. But the claim that Planned Parenthood does so illegally, or profits from it, are disputed.

23865,"""Of hospitals in Rick Scott’s Columbia/HCA health care company, """"A top executive said they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door.""","June 15, 2010",Group's ad attacks Rick Scott over history as Columbia/HCA CEO,Cristina Silva,"""With his multi-millions and meteoric rise to frontrunner status in the Republican gubernatorial primary, former Columbia/HCA hospital CEO Rick Scott has become a formidable figure in Florida politics.Look no further than a new attack ad by Florida First Initiative that paints Scott as a ruthless moneyman whose success hinged on shunning the nation's poor, and in at least one incident, the near-dead. The shadow group, a 527 under federal tax code, has used rival Bill McCollum's name in its fundraising pitch and is unregistered in Florida.Attack ads generally try to undermine an opposing camp, and the rancor seeping from this ad campaign comes across as a screaming alarm bell. """"As CEO, Rick Scott profited from the largest Medicare fraud in American history,"""" begins Refused, a 30-second spot that began airing June 12, 2010. """"His hospitals illegally refused emergency room patients who were poor. They turned away sick people... and pregnant women. """"The ad is set against a backdrop of images of seemingly frail elderly men and women and a harrowing score.The most shocking claim comes near the end of the ad: """"A top executive said they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door."""" The words, """"they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door"""" flash across the screen.The $616,282 TV ad buy is scheduled to air through Wednesday -- two days before the state election filing deadline.Scott's opponents have rarely missed the opportunity to point out his corporate troubles. Scott was CEO of Columbia/HCA in 1997 when federal agents made public an investigation into the company. Scott resigned that year. He notes that he was never indicted and says he was never questioned in the case. In a 2000 settlement, the company agreed to plead guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies, including three counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States, and pay a $1.7 billion fine. But the claim that a man died at one of the company's hospitals after being turned away was new to us. Could it be true? Federal records list Alachua County GOP Chairman Stafford Jones as the contact for Florida First Initiative. Reached by phone, he declined to answer questions and did not return a request for comment. The group's registered agent, Ken Cleary, hung up on a reporter when reached by phone. The ad attributes the allegation to an ABC News 20/20 interview from Sept. 26, 1997. We found no reference in the 20/20 transcript to """"they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door."""" We also searched a newspaper database and found no references to those exact words. The interview features Marc Gardner, a former Columbia administrator who went on a 1997 media blitz, including the appearance on 20/20, in a bid to secure a book deal about the hospital chain's alleged illegal dealings. Among his many allegations of wrongdoing, Gardner claimed the hospital and other facilities owned by Columbia/HCA limited treatment of uninsured patients. """"Columbia hospitals exist to make money -- period,"""" he told the Wall Street Journal in 1997. Gardner pointed to several deaths tied to improper care at the hospitals, including a 1995 case involving Adolph Anguiano, a homeless man who was found dead outside the Las Vegas hospital -- where Gardner served as vice president -- hours after he was examined by an emergency room doctor. We couldn't reach Gardner for comment. Scott's campaign attributed the allegation to Gardner in an e-mail response to the ad. The campaign dismissed Gardner as a """"publicity hungry wannabe writer"""" and insisted the hospital did not turn Anguiano away. Rather, he was evaluated and then discharged. The emergency room physician, Susan Meyer, was later suspended over the incident, Scott's campaign said.With Meyer's name, we tracked down court records that detail the July 1995 death.On the day he died, Anguiano was found unconscious on the lawn of a hotel and taken by ambulance to Columbia Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas. Meyer gave him a full physical, but decided against further tests, according to court records. Anguiano had not eaten in three days and had been drinking and smoking marijuana. He was given some juice and crackers, and hospital security escorted him out. He was found dead on the hospital grounds two hours later. Hospital officials said Meyer treated Anguiano for roughly seven minutes, which violated hospital rules, according to court records. Meyer was suspended. She sued the hospital and lost. The Nevada Supreme Court eventually concluded the hospital acted with the reasonable belief that it was furthering quality care. Hospital officials said they worried Anguiano's death might be seen as new evidence of """"patient dumping,"""" or refusal to treat patients in need of emergency care, according to court records. Federal law prohibits emergency rooms from turning away patients because they don't have insurance. Columbia Sunrise had already been under investigation for denying care to uninsured patients after a homeless person passed out at a casino shortly after being released from the hospital in 1994, according to multiple news reports. Federal officials threatened to take away the hospital's Medicare contract until a second investigation a few weeks later found the hospital was providing emergency beds to the uninsured. Columbia Sunrise wasn't the only Columbia/HCA hospital hounded by reports of patient dumping. From 1988 to 1997, Columbia/HCA was fined at least $180,000 for alleged patient dumping violations at eight hospitals, according to news accounts. In all of those settlements, the company did not admit wrongdoing. Where does all that leave us? We know a former Columbia/HCA executive did complain about the company's alleged penchant for patient dumping. In several interviews, he discussed the death of Adolph Anguiano, a homeless man who was found on hospital property. Court records confirm Anguiano died outside a Columbia/HCA hospital and that the hospital was under scrutiny for mistreating poor patients. But Anguiano was not turned away, as the ad claims. He received some care before he was shown the door. Also, court records state Anguiano wasn't intentionally left to die.So while what happened to Anguiano is an ugly tale, it is not as ugly as the story portrayed in the attack ad.""","http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/scotts-political-opponents-correct-his-former-hospital-company-committed/1101540, http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/1997/Jul-26-Sat-1997/business/5720722.html, http://www.lexisone.com/lx1/caselaw/freecaselaw?action=OCLGetCaseDetail&format=FULL&sourceID=beejaj&searchTerm=edcG.jOSa.aadj.eddC&searchFlag=y&l1loc=FCLOW, https://www.clarkcountycourts.us/Anonymous/CaseDetail.aspx?CaseID=6788877, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOjrek8MwIw, http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/1997/Nov-08-Sat-1997/news/6381210.html",false,"Health Care, Message Machine 2010, Florida, Florida First Initiative, "
11780,Now it’s official: FDA announced that vaccines are causing autism.,"December 19, 2017","No, the FDA didn't hide information linking vaccine to autism",Amy Sherman,"""The federal government tried to hide that a common vaccine given to children causes autism, according to a misleading viral story on Facebook. """"Now it’s official: FDA announced that vaccines are causing autism,"""" stated a headline on truthcommand.com. The story stated: """"For years, fears over vaccines and the onset of autism have been dispelled by medical professionals, but this has all changed. Parents over the years have been criticized for abstaining from getting their child vaccinated over autism fears, but now it turns out they were right all along."""" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the website misled readers about information related to the potential adverse side effects of the DTaP vaccine Tripedia manufactured in the past by Sanofi Pasteur. DTaP, a vaccine given to children in multiple doses, stands for Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, getting those diseases is much riskier than getting the vaccine. Mild problems such as a fever or swelling are common, while severe problems such as a serious allergic reaction are so """"rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine."""" The internet has been fueled with misinformation for years about a vaccine-autism link. A 1998 article in a British medical journal, the Lancet, claimed to show a link between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and autism but in 2010, the Lancet retracted the study. Scientists have repeatedly debunked the myth that vaccines cause autism through peer-reviewed studies. And yet, the spread of misinformation continues -- including by Donald Trump before and during his race for president. Vaccine pamphlet on adverse side effects Truthcommand.com stated that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration admitted that autism is a potential side effect in an online pamphlet about Tripedia: """"Adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting."""" But that section also includes a disclaimer about adverse events: """"Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine."""" Through the federal government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), anyone can file a report: doctors, patients, family members -- and they don’t need proof that the event was caused by the vaccine. Government researchers examine the reports and turn over anything suspicious to outside groups, such as the Institute of Medicine for more research. Marie McCormick, an expert on child health at the Harvard School of Public Health, told PolitiFact that the reporting system can be gamed. When the measles-thimerosal-autism controversy first emerged, activists encouraged parents to report adverse events regardless of the duration of time since the vaccination and prior events such as previous indications of developmental problems. What happened to the pamphlet on FDA’s website Truthcommand.com suggested that the FDA had tried to hide the autism link by deleting this pamphlet from the FDA’s website. But the FDA told PolitiFact that the pamphlet written by Sanofi Pasteur in 2005 wasn’t actually deleted -- the FDA archived it and sent PolitiFact a link to the pamphlet. It’s no surprise that the pamphlet was archived on the FDA’s website because the vaccine hasn’t been available for many years. Cristine K. Schroeder, a spokeswoman for Sanofi Pasteur, told PolitiFact that the company’s last shipment of Tripedia occurred in 2012. """"Tripedia is not in use today,"""" she said. The company’s pamphlets for current vaccines for DTaP, Daptacel, Pentacel and Quadracel, do not list autism as a potential adverse event. They do show data from clinical trials about side effects such as the percentage of children who got a fever, or became drowsy. Tripedia was originally licensed by the FDA in the early 1990s, FDA spokeswoman Megan McSeveney told PolitiFact. The drug maker had to follow what was at the time broad label requirements for adverse events. More recent federal regulations about drug labeling approved in 2006 are now more narrow and state that the only adverse events that have to be reported are those """"for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event."""" The scientific evidence does not support a link between any vaccine, including Tripedia (DTaP), and autism or other developmental disorders, McSeveney said. The truthcommand.com website states that it aims """"to raise awareness to issues ignored by the media."""" We contacted the email address listed on the website and did not get a reply. Part way through our reporting the story was no longer accessible on the website. The misleading story has circulated at least since March 2016 when Snopes debunked it. Truthcommand.com stated """"Now it’s official: FDA announced that vaccines are causing autism."""" But the FDA did no such thing.

17816,No doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare.,"October 16, 2013","""Coulter said that """"no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare."""" Nothing in the law bars American-trained physicians from treating newly insured people under Obamacare. It’s a ridiculous claim -- one with a whiff of xenophobia.""",Louis Jacobson,"""Conservative commentator Ann Coulter is not known for mincing words, but a recent column prompted many PolitiFact readers to contact us, seeking a fact-check. In the Oct. 9, 2013, column -- titled, """"Democrats to America: We Own the Government!"""" -- Coulter pummels Democrats over provisions of President Barack Obama’s health care law. We were most intrigued by one claim, since we hadn’t heard it before -- that """"no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare."""" Really? We tried to ask Coulter through her speaker’s bureau if she could provide any evidence for this, but we did not receive a reply. We are sure the claim wasn't intended as a joke, because it's included in a bullet-point list of straightforward criticisms of the law. So let’s start by looking at the claim literally. Is there any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would prevent U.S.-trained doctors from accepting """"Obamacare"""" patients -- that is, patients who secure insurance through the marketplaces that are a centerpiece of the law? We feel comfortable, both from talking to experts and from our years of reporting on the law, that there is no such provision. If there were, it would probably be ripe for challenge on constitutional grounds. In fact, when we asked experts for their reaction to this claim, their responses included words such as """"outrageous,"""" """"ridiculous"""" and """"ludicrous."""" """"Of course there's nothing in the law that would bar any doctor from seeing any patient,"""" said Katherine Baicker, a health economist at the Harvard School of Public Health. So, no dice on the literal reading of her claim. Still, we wondered whether there was some other tiny, buried grain of truth in what Coulter claimed. Is the idea that American-trained doctors will be pickier about accepting insurance? There is some evidence that medical practices are wary about taking patients from plans sold on the marketplace. In September, the Medical Group Management Association -- a trade group for medical-practice executives -- surveyed 1,000 physician groups that collectively employ 47,500 doctors. The survey asked, among other things, """"Does your practice plan to participate with any new health insurance products sold on an ACA exchange?"""" Only 29 percent of respondents gave a definitive """"yes."""" That rate is twice as high as the share that that said """"no"""" (14 percent) but less than those that were still weighing their options (40 percent). The top reasons? A fear of bureaucratic regulations, low reimbursement rates and the need to collect payment from patients with higher deductibles. However, it’s important to remember that this study is not evidence that can be used to support Coulter’s specific claim, because it says nothing about foreign-trained doctors. In fact, the closer you look at the issue of foreign-trained doctors, the less plausible Coulter’s claim becomes. According to a 2010 study by the American Medical Association, about 26 percent of physicians in the United States were trained in other countries. This number includes both foreign-born doctors who trained overseas and Americans who received their medical education in other countries. But tough licensing requirements for foreign-trained doctors -- requirements that won’t be changed by Obama’s law -- are keeping the number of foreign-trained physicians low. A key barrier is the need to obtain a residency in the United States, even if an applicant had practiced or had a residency overseas. According to the New York Times, just 42 percent of foreign-trained immigrant physicians who applied for residencies through the leading matching service succeeded, compared to 94 percent of those who had trained in the United States. With such high barriers to entry, it’s not credible that a flood of foreign-trained doctors will suddenly swoop in and, without the help of a single American-trained doctor, serve each one of the newly insured patients who bought policies on the new marketplaces. """"I haven't seen any study that would suggest that American-trained doctors would be disproportionately less likely to see the newly insured,"""" Baicker said. And even if there were such evidence, """"disproportionate is a far cry from ‘none,’ """" said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. """"There is no limit to the nonsense that some are saying. This borders on the absurd."""" Our ruling Coulter said that """"no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare.""""

Crist has flip-flopped on a lot of issues, including the federal health care law. He used to oppose the Affordable Care Act, but now he supports it. The law tries to bring down future health care costs by reducing Medicare Advantage payments. But on the issue of Medicare Advantage, Crist has actually been consistent: He's been critical of the Medicare Advantage cuts for years. He specifically said he opposed the reductions in 2009 and 2010, and he still opposes them today. Crist doesn’t appear to have come up with other ways to save money on health care without reducing payments to Medicare Advantage. But our purpose here is to fact-check the claim that he supports the cuts, and we found no proof that he does.",Amy Sherman,"""Gov. Rick Scott used his visit to an assisted living facility in Tampa to create a campaign video to bash President Barack Obama over potential cuts to Medicare Advantage. Scott’s Republican Party of Florida goes a step further by portraying his likely Democratic opponent, former Gov. Charlie Crist, as an Obama supporter. """"I stand against Charlie Crist because he supports President Obama and the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program,"""" said the Republican Party of Florida on Facebook April 1. They repeated the claim again on Twitter on April 9. It’s a fact that Crist supports Obama -- and the Affordable Care Act. (We traced Crist’s various positions on the law in 2010.) But does Crist support cuts to Medicare Advantage? Background on Medicare Advantage In Florida, about 1.4 million seniors are on Medicare Advantage while roughly 4.4 million are in traditional Medicare. The health care law tries to bring down future health care costs of Medicare largely by reducing Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans that are run by private insurers. The hope was that the increased competition from the private sector would reduce costs. But those plans are actually costlier than traditional Medicare. So the health care law reduces payments to private insurers. Advantage plans are required to offer basic health benefits that are at least as rich as original Medicare. But many offer extras, such as rebates on premiums, routine dental care, gym memberships and rides to the doctor, in order to compete for business. When the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, one of the attempts to pay for subsidized health insurance was to cut payments to the Medicare Advantage program to bring costs more in line with traditional Medicare. The Congressional Budget Office has predicted these cuts would save the government about $156 billion over a decade. What Crist has said about cutting Medicare Advantage We searched for statements Crist made about Medicare Advantage starting in 2009 when he was Florida’s Republican governor. We found Crist has actually opposed changes to Medicare Advantage over the years. In December 2009, Crist released a statement in support of an amendment by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to protect Medicare and Medicare Advantage. As you’ll see from his rhetoric, Crist opposed the health care law back then: """"Cuts to Medicare would adversely affect Florida’s seniors who have paid into the program and rely on its services for their important health needs. ... Many of Florida’s seniors rely on Medicare Advantage for supplemental or increased benefit options. Stripping away a needed benefit from our seniors in order to move toward a single-payer system where bureaucrats are inserted between doctors and their patients is not the health reform Americans deserve."""" In July 2010 -- after he became an independent while running for U.S. Senate -- Crist released another statement about his position on the health care bill. Here is a portion: """"Had I been in the United States Senate at the time, I would have voted against the bill because of unacceptable provisions like the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. But being an independent, I have the freedom to be an honest broker for the people of Florida without regard for political party, and the reality is this: despite its serious flaws, the Obama health care bill does have some positive aspects. Repeal must be accompanied by a responsible substitute....."""" In August 2010, he made a similar statement in which he said if he had been a senator, """"I would have voted against the bill because of unacceptable provisions like the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program."""" Again he called for a """"responsible substitute."""" Miami Herald politics reporter Marc Caputo wrote a column about Crist’s """"Obamacare conundrum"""" in March 2014. Caputo quoted a statement by Crist: """"I don’t support the cuts to Medicare Advantage. In every major law, there are things you like and things you don’t. The president and Congress should fix it."""" It’s not an unusual position to support the law and yet speak against changes for Medicare Advantage. In an election year, dozens of Democratic members of the House or Senate have spoken against Medicare Advantage rate reductions. At the time of RPOF’s claim, Medicare Advantage cuts were still on the table -- so we will limit our rating to information available at the time. However, we will note that after the federal government’s announcement that it would not reduce payments to Medicare Advantage, Crist tweeted on April 7: """"Great to learn that @BarackObama is reversing cuts to Medicare Advantage. This is great news for Florida seniors."""" So what evidence does the Republican Party of Florida have that Crist supports the cuts? """"If he supports the law, he supports all of it,"""" including Medicare Advantage cuts, RPOF spokeswoman Susan Hepworth told PolitiFact Florida in an email. One final footnote about Crist and Medicare Advantage. The federal government is depending on savings from Medicare Advantage to offset the costs of the Affordable Care Act. So we asked the Crist campaign, if Crist is against the Medicare Advantage cuts, what would he recommend to achieve the needed savings? We did not hear any specific solutions from Crist campaign spokesman Kevin Cate. """"It’s the responsibility of the president and Congress to fix any cuts to Medicare Advantage,"""" Cate said. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said Crist supports """"cuts to the Medicare Advantage program."""" Crist has flip-flopped on a lot of issues, including the federal health care law. He used to oppose the Affordable Care Act, but now he supports it. The law tries to bring down future health care costs by reducing Medicare Advantage payments. But on the issue of Medicare Advantage, Crist has actually been consistent: He's been critical of the Medicare Advantage cuts for years.

9005,"Clinical Trial Offers Natural Eczema Treatment, Using Good Bacteria to Fight the Bad","May 2, 2018","The news release highlights a new clinical trial using a twice daily lotion containing what we’re told is “good bacteria” used to fight “bad bacteria” in order to restore the “natural microbial balance” of patients with eczema, or atopic dermatitis. The premise of this research is that introducing “good bacteria” might decrease the population of Staphlococcus aureus —  a bacterium that’s part of the normal flora of our skin and respiratory tract, and speculated to play a role in making eczema worse. But as with many treatments based on the microbiome, the benefits are touted with language that — although it sounds reasonable and appealing — is not backed by existing research. In fact, here there is no research. The sponsors are still recruiting volunteers for the trial. That should have been made more clear. The news release does explain why a less toxic alternative might have advantages over existing therapies such as antibiotics and corticosteroids. Eczema is a very common skin disorder that is notoriously difficult to treat. Finding an effective and non-toxic treatment alternative would be a boon to both patients and those who might develop such a treatment. But it’s important to note that the cause of eczema is unknown; it’s thought to be triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. That’s why treatment is focused on minimizing  possible triggers and symptoms. It’s also a disease that can repeatedly flare up and significantly compromise people’s quality of life. A non-toxic therapy — as this approach promises to be — could have a major impact on the lives of these people, some of whom are quite incapacitated by this disease. Promising them a long-term solution based on very preliminary, unpublished results is unwarranted. It is very unlikely that one approach, such as altering the microbiome, will yield results for a majority of eczema sufferers.","Michael Joyce, MD,Kathleen Fairfield, MD, DrPH,Kathlyn Stone","This lotion is still in clinical trials. Pricing is most likely unavailable. We’re told the lotion contains “beneficial bacteria to fight harmful bacteria,” and the lead investigator is quoted as saying that this will “help the skin gain back it’s natural balance and create that barrier needed to keep it healthy.” But we’re given no data from the trials to support this. We’re also not given any context regarding what good bacteria, natural balance, or “that barrier” are. The only example of a “bad” bacteria mentioned is Staphylococcus aureus. The news release informs us that Staph. aureus makes eczema worse. Previous studies have shown that high levels of Staph. aureus do correlate with increasing severity of eczema. The lead investigator suggests that applying the lotion twice a day will “eliminate all staph aureus.” But there’s no evidence included to show that this lotion actually improves the eczema. It should have been acknowledged that staph aureas colonization might be associated with eczema severity and not a cause of it. For example, if people with more severe eczema scratch more, they are more likely to colonize themselves with bacteria they pick up in the environment around them. This does not indicate that reducing the staph will result in improvement of the underlying disorder. No potential harms from using the lotion are mentioned. Could there be allergic reactions? If the lotion does, indeed, reduce the amount of Staph. aureus on the skin, are there consequences to that? Or consequences to changing the skin’s microbial balance in general? Also, many eczema patients are acutely aware that their skin is not just fragile, but also may have open sores; should a bacterial lotion be applied to broken skin? And does this put them at risk of a bacterial infection that can spread? It’s mentioned that “there is more research to be done” but it’s unclear whether any people have thus far been tested. The release also alludes to a future safety trial and a larger study “to see if the benefits of bacterial cream can truly provide a permanent solution for eczema patients.” This is a far cry from the claims that this cream “restores the natural balance of healthy skin,” and has the potential to be “a long-term solution.” There’s no indication that any preliminary results have been peer-reviewed, published, or presented at medical conferences. We’re only given the anecdote of one woman, but nothing about her response to the treatment. The news release is clearly jumping to describing a new treatment that sounds beneficial without any evidence at all. No disease mongering. Atopic dermatitis is very common and difficult to treat. Funding sources for this clinical trial are not mentioned. Potential conflicts of interest are also not addressed and this could be relevant since a quick check of the lead author on Dollars for Docs reveals multiple sources of industry funding in the past. The article does well in mentioning two alternative treatments for eczema that can often prove problematic: antibiotics and corticosteroids. There are a host of other treatment options as listed here. The release suggests the benefit of the cream was already proven and hints that the treatment would be available soon. It would have been helpful to note for readers something like, “because this lotion is in clinical trials, it is not currently available on the market; furthermore the preliminary results have not been published or peer-reviewed.” There are a number of probiotic creams for sale, according to a quick search of Amazon. What is different about the one being tested? The release doesn’t rely on sensational terms so we’ll give it a Satisfactory. The unwarranted claims, such as alluding to a possible “long-term solution” for eczema without providing any evidence, are addressed under other criteria.","https://www.healthnewsreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/iStock_000018320229_Medium.jpg,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/podcastmedia/microbiome-media-hype/",false,"eczema,microbiome,National Jewish Health"

Some bloggers and Facebook users say that’s a mistake. In a June 27 article, a website called OffGuardian wrote that the tests many health care providers use to diagnose COVID-19 are """"scientifically meaningless."""" """"These PCR tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool to determine an alleged infection by a supposedly new virus called SARS-CoV-2,"""" reads the article, which has been shared more than thousands of times on Facebook. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has also been copy-pasted into text posts, which have also been shared thousands of times. (Screenshot from Facebook) OffGuardian was launched in 2015. The site’s name comes from the fact that its founders were all """"banned from the Guardian’s ‘Comment is Free’ sections,"""" according to its about section. OffGuardian has a track record of publishing conspiracy theories and Russian propaganda, so we wanted to take a closer look at its claim about COVID-19 testing. The article is inaccurate — polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are among the most common and reliable ways to test for the coronavirus. Similar claims have circulated, and have been fact-checked, since March. There are three main coronavirus tests: diagnostic, antibody and antigen. Diagnostic tests, also known as PCR tests, look for the genetic material of the coronavirus in a sample that’s typically taken from a person’s nose or throat. Health care providers and public health officials use them to confirm whether someone has the disease. In a fact sheet for its PCR test, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the test is """"designed to detect the virus that causes COVID-19 in respiratory specimens, for example nasal or oral swabs."""" """"If you have a positive test result, it is very likely that you have COVID-19,"""" the document says. That’s because PCR tests amplify small segments of DNA, making it easier for labs to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Health care providers have also used them for detecting viruses like HIV. It usually takes several days to get results. In its 4,500-word article, OffGuardian lays out several (inaccurate) theories about PCR tests. None of them prove that the tests are """"scientifically meaningless."""" OffGuardian wrote in its article that the inventor of the PCR test, Kary Mullis, """"regarded the PCR as inappropriate to detect a viral infection."""" In a fact-check, Reuters rated that claim false — the source is a 1996 article about HIV/AIDS. It does not say PCR tests are ineffective for detecting viruses. OffGuardian makes several other inaccurate claims in its article, including: """"There are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19."""" The CDC says otherwise. """"The existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is based on faith, not fact."""" Several researchers have analyzed the genetic material of the coronavirus — including its RNA.

""""We don't have concentration camps here in Iowa,"""" she said. And then she sighed. """"Those are words I never thought I'd have to say."""" The rumor spread wide enough that the Iowa Department of Public Health felt the need to isssue a press release on Aug. 31 to knock it down.

The e-mail links to a  """"Facility Quarantine Order."""" It's a legitimate document, a template to be used in the event that Iowa ever did decide to quarantine people. It reads, in part: """"The Iowa Department of Public Health (Department) has determined that you have had contact with a person with Novel Influenza A H1N1. Novel Influenza A H1N1 is a disease which is spread from person to person and is associated with fever (greater than 100.0 F), cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea (runny nose), nasal congestion, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Novel Influenza A H1N1 presents a risk of serious harm to public health and if it spreads in the community severe public health consequences may result. """"The Department has determined that it is necessary to quarantine your movement to a specific facility to prevent further spread of this disease. The Department has determined that quarantine in your home and other less restrictive alternatives are not acceptable because — insert the reason home quarantine is not acceptable, the person violated a previously issued home quarantine order, the person does not have an appropriate home setting conducive to home quarantine, etc. The Department is therefore ordering you to comply with the following provisions during the entire period of quarantine.""""

""""In preparation for public health emergencies, these types of templates are often prepared in case they are needed, but isolation and quarantine orders are only very rarely used in very specific situations."""" The templates were prepared when H1N1 first reared up in Mexico, when it was feared to be much more deadly than it turned out to be, Quinlisk said. """"As soon as we realized it wasn't that bad, or at least that it was similar to the seasonal flu, that was the end of that,"""" she said.

According to the chain e-mail, the bill would allow """" 'authorities' to impose vaccinations. If you refuse, they can haul you away into quarantine. If you refuse that, you'll be fined up to $1,000 per day, and possibly be incarcerated in prison for 30 days."""" On Oct. 8, the Massachusetts legislature did sign off on a bill to tighten the powers of public health officials to isolate or quarantine people to contain the outbreak of serious contagious diseases. But that doesn't translate to """"a law that will mandate vaccines for the swine flu."""" In fact, said Jennifer Manley, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Department of Health, """"There will absolutely, positively  not  be any mandatory vaccines for the H1N1 virus in Massachusetts."""" Most states have laws more than 100 years old that allow people who pose a public health danger to be isolated or quarantined, Quinlisk said. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many states looked into updating those laws to ensure, among other things, that people's civil rights are not violated. Some have clearly misinterpreted those efforts and assigned them insidious intent, she said. No states are considering quarantining people with H1N1. """"Quarantine is a public health tool that is primarily used to keep well people who have been potentially exposed to a serious illness away from others who may be susceptible,"""" said Christine Pearson with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. """"It's particularly effective when a new disease has not yet been introduced into our country.

Cavuto pressed Keely Mullen with the Million Student March on how she would pay for a program to make public college tuition-free, forgive all current college debt and pay college students $15 an hour. """"If you wanted all that stuff, someone has to pick up the tab,"""" Cavuto asked on his Nov. 12 show. """"Who would that be?"""" """"The 1 percent of society that are hoarding all the wealth and causing a catastrophe that students are facing,"""" Mullen answered. Cavuto pushed back and presented Mullen with this scenario to demonstrate the limits of getting the wealthy to pony up. """"They’ve done studies on this, Keely,"""" Cavuto said. """"I don’t want to get boring here. But even if you were to take the 1 percent, and take all of their money, tax it 100 percent. Do you know it wouldn’t keep Medicare -- just Medicare -- going for three years? """" Several readers asked us to check Cavuto’s basic math. Could the wealthiest 1 percent pay for Medicare for three years or not? We don’t want to get boring either, but reader be warned: Numbers, multiplication and subtraction lie ahead. We asked the Fox Business Network for studies backing up Cavuto’s math. The Fox press office didn’t point us to any studies. Instead, a spokeswoman explained that Cavuto and his producer averaged the yearly income going to the top 1 percent as reported by the Internal Revenue Service for 2011, 2012 and 2013. They came up with """"about $1.75 trillion."""" For the cost of Medicare, they went to two sources: The Kaiser Family Foundation, which we’ll get to in a moment, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services web page on national health expenditures for 2013. That page gave them the figure of $585.7 billion of Medicare expenditures. They multiplied the Medicare number by three and found that it would be $1.755 trillion over three years. The correct number is actually $1.757 trillion, but the point remains the same. Using Cavuto’s estimate, three years of Medicare spending is more than all the money the top 1 percent took in. We tried to repeat Cavuto’s analysis and ran into some issues. Problems with the Medicare dollars Cavuto’s Medicare spending number is not bulletproof. There are credible, lower figures. Medicare spending is reported in two ways: Gross outlays and net outlays. Gross outlays are basically money out the door, and net outlays reduces the total based on the money Medicare takes in apart from the federal budget and the payroll tax. We found a discrepancy in the gross outlay number. While the CMS fact sheet does report $585.7 billion in gross spending, the Medicare Trustees, the program’s overseers, reported a slightly lower $582.9 billion for 2013. Since that comes from the Trustees' official report to Congress, we gave it some weight. (The difference is due to accounting rules.) We also found that the other source cited by Fox Business, the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is widely seen as a neutral source of health care data, focuses on the net outlays, not the gross spending. Fox Business directed us to the foundation’s Medicare fact-sheet. That page reports the net figure, which factors in billions of dollars of premiums paid by Medicare users, along with recaptured inappropriate payments to providers. For 2013, Kaiser reported net spending of $492 billion. Juliette Cubanski, a top Medicare analyst at Kaiser, explained that the net amount does a better job of capturing the burden on taxpayers as a whole. """"Showing the gross spending amount would, in a way, overstate federal spending on Medicare because some of that amount comes back to the Treasury in the form of premiums,"""" Cubanski said. So the Medicare Trustees provided a slightly lower number than Cavuto used, and his other source provided a significantly lower number. Both measures put his math at risk. Problems with the top 1 percent dollars Cavuto used IRS data for 2011, 2012 and 2013. It’s easy to find the IRS analysis of the Adjusted Gross Income, or AGI, for the top 1 percent for 2011 and 2012. But the official analysis only comes out about three years after the fact, and the 2013 numbers are not available. So where did Cavuto get an estimate for 2013 income? His staff said he used an IRS spreadsheet for 2013. However, this only gives you a rough approximation, and when we compared past spreadsheets to the official analyses for 2011 and 2012, we found significant differences. Nonetheless, there is another issue with Cavuto’s income figure. Adjusted Gross Income misses a fair chunk of the money people actually make. There are many deductions in taxable income that come before taxpayers reaches that point in their tax returns. One of the largest takes the form of tax-free contributions to a retirement account. In a perfect world, one would be able to say precisely the actual incomes, before any deductions, of the top 1 percent. In practice, that turns out to be a tricky business, said Daniel Feenberg, a tax expert at the National Bureau of Economic Research. """"There are many ways to do this calculation, including many that are correct but differ from each other,"""" Feenberg said. The Tax Policy Center, a joint effort of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, has a method to estimate what it calls the """"cash income"""" of tax filers. Its model adds back in the dollars put into a retirement account, along with non-taxable Social Security and pension income, and various other pots of money. Averaging the center’s estimates of cash income for the top 1 percent for 2011, 2012 and 2013 produces a total of $1.85 trillion. That’s about $100 billion more than Cavuto’s estimate for the top 1 percent. The center’s co-director William Gale warned us that using tax returns to measure income totally misses a major source of income for the top 1 percent: gains on financial holdings that accrue but aren’t cashed out. """"When Warren Buffett’s stocks go up up by X billion over a year, none of that shows up in his AGI unless he sells some of the assets,"""" Gale said. Setting aside the huge policy debate involved here, measuring income in any given year is a particularly poor yardstick for the financial capacity of the top 1 percent. Way more than most people, they get to decide when to turn their wealth into income. Running the numbers For the last step of this fact-check, we stress-tested Cavuto’s assertion. The math is simple: You triple a given Medicare spending number and subtract that from an income estimate. We did the math using three different amounts for Medicare spending and three different estimates of the income of the top 1 percent. For the IRS, we use the most recent available AGI figure from 2012. (We know that due to efforts to avoid higher capital gains taxes, many people sold assets in 2012. This artificially raised the AGI figure that year, but we’ve yet to find a report that shows the size of that effect in terms of the income of the top 1 percent.) With that caveat, here is the table -- using all the sources above -- showing what you’re left with when you take one year of income for the 1 percent and subtract the three-year cost of Medicare. A negative number means the Medicare total was more than the income --  as Cavuto said. The green background is where Cavuto is correct. The red is where he is not. The amounts are in billions of dollars. There’s only one outcome that supports Cavuto’s assertion that the income of the 1 percent wouldn’t pay for three years of Medicare spending — the one that uses his own sources. The remaining eight scenarios based on other reputable sources show the income of the 1 percent exceeding three years of Medicare spending, ranging from a difference of $1.3 billion to $504 billion. Cavuto’s method is very sensitive to small shifts in the numbers. Even using his income estimate but relying on the gross spending figure from the Medicare Trustees, he missed the mark. Not by much, but his assertion is still not right. The gap only gets wider if you use any other estimate of income and any other Medicare spending amount. If you use the Kaiser Family Foundation’s number for Medicare ($492 billion) and the the Tax Policy Center’s number for income ($1.85 trillion), the money from the wealthiest 1 percent would cover Medicare for about three years and nine months. Our ruling Cavuto said that one year of the income of the top 1 percent would not pay for three years of Medicare. His point was that the financial capacity of the top 1 percent is not unlimited. He bolstered his point with a definitive statement, but the underlying math is flawed. Cavuto used the highest number we could find for the cost of Medicare. While he may have relied on an official web page for his Medicare number, we found an equally official source, the Medicare Trustees, that reported a lower figure.

26447,Facebook post Says Wisconsin’s in-person election has caused a “surge” in new coronavirus cases,"April 21, 2020","The claimed surge in cases was based on poor data work. The upward “trend” treated a dip in new cases due to lower testing as a baseline, rather than the outlier it was. State health officials say they haven’t yet seen evidence the election changed the trajectory of coronavirus in Wisconsin. Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 have actually dropped in Wisconsin since April 13 — the date cited in the story.",Eric Litke,"""Wisconsin’s mid-pandemic election was a unique spectacle. The courtroom drama preceding the vote — and Wisconsin’s status as the only state with a primary election around this time that didn’t delay or cancel in-person voting — drew national attention and criticism. The fundamental question was simple: What would this do to the state’s coronavirus trends? Though polling places attempted to institute social distancing, voters said it was impossible to maintain at all times, particularly in Milwaukee and Green Bay where masses of voters were shuttled through just a handful of locations. A few people have tried to answer this question in the time since, including an April 17, 2020, article shared widely on Facebook. The story claimed """"immense consequences"""" from in-person voting, with this headline: """"New Virus Cases Surge in Wisconsin a Week After Republicans Forced In-Person Election to Go Forward."""" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Have confirmed coronavirus cases really surged after the in-person election? No, they haven’t. At least not yet. Here’s what we found. The article, posted by the website Second Nexus, pulled its sole statistical evidence from a tweet by Topher Spiro, a health policy analyst with more than 100,000 followers on Twitter. He posted a chart showing a dip in the number of positive cases on April 13, followed by increases each of the next three days. The accompanying text said, """"Check out the uptick in transmission the GOP caused by forcing an in-person election in Wisconsin."""" People who contract COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, typically don’t start showing symptoms for about five days. A study of 181 cases in China found the median incubation period — time before symptoms show — was five days, and only 1% first showed symptoms after 14 days (hence the standard 14-day quarantine). Spiro and the Second Nexus story are starting with a point a week after the April 7 election and saying the increase in new cases is connected. But there are several critical data errors here. First, calling the post-April 13 increase a trend assumes that April 13 is a valid baseline. If the state had been at the April 13 level for some time, then an increase from that level could be proof of a new trend. But that’s not what happened. April 13 was a very unusual day for coronavirus testing. The state administered an average of 1,600 coronavirus tests daily in the first three weeks of April. But on April 13 it administered only 940 — 400 less than any other day. Predictably, with fewer tests came fewer positive results, and a large dip in the number of new confirmed cases. The rise in the days after — identified by the story as proof of the election impact — was actually just a result of the number of tests growing to 1,355, then 1,495, then 1,802 the four days after April 13. Before and after that date, the percentage of tests that came back positive remained about the same: between 9% and 10% When presented with this data, Spiro deleted his tweet. """"It looks like testing has increased since April 13 and the positive rate has remained roughly constant,"""" he said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. The truth is, at the time of the Second Nexus article — and this one — it’s too soon to say what impact the election had on Wisconsin’s coronavirus outbreak. But so far there is no sign of an increase, said Andrea Palm, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. In the state’s daily coronavirus briefing on April 20, 2020, she also noted the time between contracting the disease and being a confirmed case involves more than just the five-day median incubation time. """"I think folks do need to remember sort of the progression of this virus, from infection to symptoms to the conversation with your physician to the test to the test results,"""" Palm said.

James Quintero, director of the Center for Local Governance at the Austin-based Texas Public Policy Foundation, brought up health implications of shoppers reusing bags during an Oct. 10, 2016, SXSW Eco panel discussion. """"There are health consequences in that,"""" Quintero said. """"I believe this is in San Francisco: When they enacted their bag ban, you saw the number of instances of people going to the ER with things like salmonella and other related illnesses—you saw that number spike."""" Someone on the panel responded: """"Wait, that’s curious. I never heard that before."""" Quintero replied: """"So you have a reusable bag, right? And then of course, people don’t clean out these bags. So when you mix meat with vegetables and fruits and other goods, and you don’t clean out that bag on a regular basis, then people are susceptible to foodborne illnesses."""" Take note: Health authorities recommend you wash bags regularly used to carry meats and vegetables. For this fact check, we were curious about what happened when San Francisco banned plastic bags. Quintero cites professors’ paper We asked a foundation spokeswoman, Caroline Espinosa, to share the basis of Quintero’s claim. By email, Espinosa pointed us to a November 2012 paper, """"Grocery Bag Bans and Foodborne Illness,"""" by Jonathan Klick and Joshua Wright, law professors at the University of Pennsylvania and George Mason University, respectively. In their write-up, posted by a University of Pennsylvania research center, the authors noted that San Francisco County barred large supermarkets and pharmacies from using """"non-compostable plastic checkout bags,"""" effective Oct. 20, 2007. In 2012, the county’s board of supervisors """"expanded the non-compostable plastic checkout bag ban to cover all retail and food establishments in"""" the county, effective Oct. 1, 2012, the paper says, also requiring stores to charge at least a dime for any bag provided. """"To analyze emergency room visits,"""" the authors wrote, """"we used the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development’s Emergency Department and Ambulatory Surgery Data for each quarter from 2005-2010. These data provide the county of residence of each person admitted to a California ER, as well as the principal diagnosis for the individual using ICD-9 codes. Given the prevalence of coliform bacteria, especially E. coli, in reusable grocery bags, we focus on ER visits involving E. coli,"""" the two said. And? The San Francisco bag ban is """"associated with a statistically significant and particularly large increase in ER visits for E. Coli infections. We find increases between one fourth and two thirds, suggesting an increase in visits between 72 and 191 annually,"""" the paper said. All told, the authors said, the bag ban there is """"associated with a 46 percent increase in deaths from foodborne illnesses. This implies an increase of 5.5 annual deaths for the county."""" On the other hand, the study’s small sample size make """"any inferential claims"""" tentative, the authors wrote. We emailed and telephoned each professor and didn’t hear back. San Francisco County memo Hunting perspective, we then ran the authors’ names through the Nexis news database. That query led us to a March 2013 story posted by Texas-based D Magazine stating a San Francisco health officer had spelled out flaws in the professors’ paper. That story included a web link to a Feb. 8, 2013, memo from a San Francisco County health officer, Tomás Aragon, to Eileen Shields, a county public health information officer. The memo said the county Department of Public Health had reviewed the professors’ paper which, the officer noted, """"has not been submitted for rigorous scientific peer review and publication."""" Generally, the memo states, """"Klick & Wright’s conclusion that San Francisco’s policy of banning of plastic bags has caused a significant increase in gastrointestinal bacterial infections and a ‘46 percent increase in the deaths from foodborne illnesses’ is not warranted."""" One weakness, the memo says, was that the professors presumed a link between reusable bags and a seeming spike in gastrointestinal bacterial infections--yet they failed to establish the link. """"Drawing causal conclusions from this type of study is called an ‘ecological fallacy,’"""" the memo states. """"The basic study flaw is that persons that use reusable bags frequently may not be the same persons that were diagnosed with gastrointestinal bacterial infections in their study. This is the reason epidemiologists will not use ecological studies to test causal hypotheses. At best, ecologic studies raise epidemiologic causal hypotheses but cannot test them."""" The memo continues: """"In testing causal hypotheses, it is necessary to measure the outcome (gastrointestinal infections) and exposure to the putative cause (reusable bags) in the same persons. Because of their study design, this was not possible."""" Also, the memo says that in """"testing causal hypotheses, it is necessary to ‘control for’ alternative causal explanations (called ‘confounders’). Because of their study design, this was not possible. For example, gastrointestinal bacterial infections are not only caused from contaminated food, but also from contaminated water, improper food handling or preparation, or from person-to-person spread (such as sexual activity, especially in men who have sex with men). In any causal study, investigators always adjust for the ‘usual suspects,’"""" the memo says. Moreover, the memo notes that the study’s focus on illnesses identified in emergency rooms misses that people seek care at other places--or not at all--leaving the data incomplete. Alternatively, the memo says, laboratory-confirmed diagnoses reported to the health department are """"the proper basis for surveillance of microbiological data on these infections in our population."""" The official went on to say there had been increases in some illnesses oft linked to food. Specifically, according to the memo, health department data show an increase in campylobacteriosis, one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness. Then again, the memo says, there was no detected increase in salmonellosis or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, which is transmitted by food or water contaminated with animal or human feces. """"Interpreting these changes is not straightforward,"""" the memo continues. """"The epidemiology of enteric pathogens in San Francisco differs compared to surrounding counties because we are an urban center with a larger population of ethnic immigrants and men who have sex with men (MSM),"""" the memo states. """"Research studies need to adjust for these population differences."""" The memo also disputes the professors’ conclusions about deaths going up after the bag ban, mostly by declaring that 111 of the 140 San Francisco deaths from 2001 through 2010 figuring into the paper were attributed to Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile--an intestinal infection most commonly tied to exposure to antibiotics, particularly among hospitalized patients. """"Foodborne exposures is not yet an established cause of C. difficile enterocolitis, but is an active area of research,"""" the memo says, going on to say the authors shouldn’t have included C. difficile deaths in their analysis. Summing up, the memo says """"the idea that widespread use of reusable bags may cause gastrointestinal infections if they are not regularly cleaned is plausible. However, the hypothesis that there is a significant increase in gastrointestinal foodborne illnesses and deaths due to reusable bags has not been tested, much less demonstrated in this study. It would be a disservice to San Francisco residents and visitors to alarm them by claiming that it has been. It could be useful, however, to remind people to use safe food-handling practices, including maintaining the cleanliness of everything they use to transport, handle, and prepare food."""" We asked San Francisco County if there had been any response by the professors to the county’s memo. Nancy Sarieh of the public health department told us by email: """"They did respond. We agreed to disagree and they have not updated their paper."""" In February 2013, we otherwise noticed, commentator Debra J. Saunders of the San Francisco Chronicle quoted Klick saying he cannot """"rule out the possibility that there was something peculiar that happened in San Francisco."""" A Texas expert Separately, we asked Dr. Philip Huang, the medical director for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department, to take a look at the paper posted by Penn plus the San Francisco County memo. Huang said by phone that the Penn paper, limited to ER admissions, missed the fact that individuals who take sick from food are treated by private doctors or don’t even seek health care. Notably too, Huang said, the researchers failed to consider the health surveillance data later cited by the county. """"I mean, who knows? You can get a spike"""" in illness """"and there could have been something else going on in the community that is totally unrelated,"""" Huang said. """"I think the people who are closest to the data in their own community would have the best perspective."""" From ER admissions alone, Huang said, """"certainly the data is not there to make any conclusions about this."""" Foundation notes other accounts Next, we circled back to Espinosa, the foundation spokeswoman, about the memo disputing the professors’ analysis and Huang’s comments. By email, Espinosa pointed out a 2011 peer-reviewed study, partly supported by the American Chemistry Council, finding that among reusable bags randomly collected from consumers entering grocery stores in the San Francisco area, Los Angeles and Tucson, E. coli were identified in 8 percent of bags plus a """"wide range of enteric bacteria,"""" according to the authors including Charles P. Gerba of the University of Arizona. """"When meat juices were added to bags and stored in the trunks of cars for two hours, the number of bacteria increased 10-fold, indicating the potential for bacterial growth in the bags,"""" the authors wrote. """"Hand or machine washing was found to reduce the bacteria in bags by > 99.9%. These results indicate that reusable bags, if not properly washed on a regular basis, can play a role in the cross-contamination of foods. """" Espinosa also noted a May 2012 Los Angeles Times news story describing an Oregon outbreak affecting nine soccer players who had come in contact with a reused grocery bag. The story said one of the girls got sick shortly after arrival, from a norovirus she presumably acquired prior to the trip, Dr. Kimberly K. Repp of the Oregon Health and Science University and Dr. William E. Keene of the Oregon Public Health Division reported in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. """"The sick girl was then isolated in the room of one of the chaperones,"""" the Times reported. """"Nonetheless, eight other girls became ill. The investigation showed that the virus was found on a reusable grocery bag that had been used to store snacks for the team. It had, unfortunately, been stored in the bathroom,"""" the story said. When the sick girl used the bathroom, the norovirus was aerosolized and deposited on the bag, where it was later transferred to other girls when they got snacks. Our ruling Quintero said that when San Francisco banned plastic grocery bags, """"you saw the number of instances of people going to the ER with things like salmonella and other related illnesses"""" spike. This declaration relied on a study that took a correlation between ER cases and San Francisco’s phased-in bag ban to declare ties between the reported illnesses and the ban. However, the county raised serious questions about the study methodology and conclusions, which were overly simplistic. – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""","http://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2013/03/far-north-texas-rep-drew-springer-is-using-bunk-science-to-prove-reusable-bags-are-killing-people/, http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/etec.html, https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/diseases/campylobacter/, https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTABWsG6G09xzT0csp7rg-fNUHpKqMLGZrSiYh9y5wtP6okhodLiOMh6tSoG5Zk0EAUXk6UNU6FJj-u/pub, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2196481, https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTMD_FFo6K1QeyreX1bdKsuJnA0LKIuB7bc6EPrT1rORPtDkeB5scHMxptea7YToj7FzrJkpKzGo559/pub, http://www.austintexas.gov/biography/medical-director-and-health-authority, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/07/plastic-bag-ban_n_2641430.html, https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-02-04/the-disgusting-consequences-of-liberal-plastic-bag-bans, http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/S-F-s-plastic-bag-ban-may-be-unhealthy-4264075.php, http://blogs.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SF-Health-Officer-MEMO-re-Reusable-Bag-Study_V8-FIN1.pdf",false,"Environment, Health Care, Public Health, Texas, James Quintero, "
24469,"""A """"massive"""" federal computer network will make your medical records available to """"millions of people"""" with a """"complete lack of privacy and confidentiality,"""" while doctors and hospitals who don't take part face """"stiff penalties.""","October 22, 2009",Seniors' group warns about risks of electronic health records,Louis Jacobson,"""Could Big Brother — or garden-variety snoopers — soon get their hands on your medical data? The Senior Citizens League, a group that boasts 1.2 million members and is affiliated with the Retired Enlisted Association, recently sent out a mailing saying it was possible. According to a copy obtained by the Huffington Post, the group sent a four-page letter, along with a questionnaire and a cover letter signed by former Rep. David Funderburk, R-N.C., to seniors, expressing two related concerns about Democratic health care reform plans being debated on Capitol Hill. One is that they could lead to the rationing of care. The other is that the government is assembling a """"national government computer network"""" that will contain Americans' medical files. We've already addressed  the question of rationing  , so we'll focus here on the plans for a computer network. Here's what the Senior Citizens League letter said:   """"The key to these changes is a massive national government computer network, which is now being created. When it is complete, your complete medical record will be available 24 hours a day to health care workers at computer terminals in pharmacies, doctors' offices and hospitals across the country and to government workers. ... To ensure that all doctors, hospitals and pharmacies participate and place their records in the new system, a portion of the economic stimulus legislation passed in February includes stiff penalties for doctors and hospitals which do not participate. The complete lack of privacy or confidentiality that comes when millions of people can see your records and the virtual certainty of computer errors has raised concern among many Medicare beneficiaries."""" First, a little background on health information technology, or HIT for short. Computerizing medical records has long been a goal of policymakers across the ideological spectrum. The idea is to shift from paper-based records to electronic ones, so that doctors can access information about their patients more quickly and easily and make better clinical decisions as a result. Supporters hope that HIT will reduce the frequency of medical errors, unnecessary diagnostic tests and inappropriate treatments. While the biggest impact would likely be felt within a patient's small circle of physicians, nurses and pharmacists, planners also envision scenarios in which an emergency room doctor treating a patient traveling far from home would be able to quickly receive medical records about that patient. Officials also hope that, in the longer term, streamlining record-keeping could bring down the rapidly escalating cost of health care. In 2004, President George W. Bush issued an executive order creating incentives for the use of health information technology, to be spearheaded by a new federal official, the national coordinator for Health Information Technology. President Barack Obama went further when Congress passed his economic stimulus package in February 2009. The stimulus included several items designed to promote HIT, including $19 billion over four years to fund electronic infrastructure improvements and the widespread adoption of electronic health records by providers. The goal under both presidents has been to create electronic health records for each person in the United States by 2014. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology describes the Nationwide Health Information Network as a """"network of networks."""" All the experts we spoke to, including the Department of Health and Human Services, emphasized that it is not a single database residing at, say, a federal agency. It's more accurately viewed as a network to link many separate databases where records already exist, such as regional databases or medical offices, along with efforts to establish common technical standards so that these far-flung repositories of data can exchange information as needed. """"While providers will eventually be required to actively exchange patient information between electronic health records, there is no law or regulation calling for the development of a national patient information database,"""" said Brian Wagner, the senior director of policy and public affairs with the eHealth Initiative, a group that represents companies and professional organizations with a stake in HIT. The Senior Citizens League excerpt raises two main questions about HIT. —  Who would have access to the network? Could it be as many as """"millions"""" of people? Our experts agreed that such loose access is certainly not the goal of the program, and they added that intensive efforts are being taken to prevent that from happening. On its Web site, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology says it understands that a lack of trust in the system would be a serious problem. """"Coordinated attention at the federal and state levels is needed both to develop and implement appropriate privacy and security policies,"""" the office says. Portions of the stimulus bill stiffened existing privacy protections from the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act, which governs how medical records can be used. The stimulus extended the list of mandatory protections and penalties to business associates of medical providers who were already covered by them. In the case of privacy breaches, patients now must be notified, and the penalties for violations were increased. Most important, providers and associates covered by HIPAA must limit disclosure of private health information to the minimum number of people necessary to accomplish a valid purpose. Those purposes generally involve treatment, payment or medical administration. """"It's not going to be available at Kinko's for all the world to see,"""" said Len Nichols, director of the health policy program at the centrist-to-liberal New America Foundation. Wagner said that the network won't be structured in a way that allows any medical professional to fish around for data on anyone they like. Users would still have to request specific information from another doctor, and provide a good reason why they need it. The main difference under a functioning system of HIT would be that that record would be sent electronically rather than faxed or mailed, potentially saving hours or days. One upside is that, unlike paper-based systems, electronic health records create audit trails every time they're accessed, meaning that HIT systems can actually afford greater privacy protections for patients. """"The level of access to this information will also be limited based on each person’s role in the provision of care,"""" said HHS spokeswoman Nancy Szemraj. """"Depending upon the type of violation, fines can reach up to $1.5 million per privacy violation."""" The notion that there will be """"unauthorized, limitless access to patient health information in an electronic health record is absolutely incorrect,"""" she said. Still, everyone agrees that vigilance is needed. Deven McGraw, director of the health privacy project at the Center for Democracy & Technology, calls it """"absolutely critical to have policies to say who can access information and for what purposes. Are they in place today? No. Are there active efforts going on today to change that? Absolutely."""" —  How stiff are the penalties for noncompliance? They're not immediate, and providers will have many opportunities to benefit from carrots before they face any sticks. Between 2011 and 2014, the stimulus provides bonus payments to encourage health care providers to implement """"meaningful"""" usage of HIT for Medicare and Medicaid. In 2015, the penalties begin. Providers who haven't instituted meaningful use of HIT would see their Medicare reimbursements (though not their Medicaid payments) reduced by 1 percent in 2015, 2 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 2017. The secretary of Health and Human Services can increase these penalties by an additional point or two if implementation significantly lags. So let's summarize. The Senior Citizens League has a point that HIT presents unprecedented challenges in privacy and security, and that strategies to keep up with these threats continue to evolve. However, the group significantly overstates the degree to which HIT is intended to collect medical data in one place and the extent to which users will be able to poke around records that they don't have a legitimate need to access. It's inaccurate to say that there will be a """"complete lack of privacy or confidentiality;"""" laws against unauthorized use are already in place, and federal officials have explicitly made privacy a high priority. Finally, the penalties against nonparticipation that the group cites begin in 2015 — after several years in which providers can receive financial bonuses for participating.""","https://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=1147&parentname=CommunityPage&parentid=3&mode=2&in_hi_userid=10741&cached=true, http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h1enr.pdf, http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2005/janqtr/pdf/3CFR13335.pdf, https://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&mode=2&cached=true&objID=1142, http://www.nixonpeabody.com/publications_detail3.asp?ID=2621, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/20/senior-citizens-league-ma_n_327583.html",false,"National, Health Care, Technology, Privacy Issues, Senior Citizens League, "

Federal health officials initially discouraged masks for the general public, only to revise their guidance later. To make matters more complicated, social media posts are claiming that wearing a mask can be more dangerous than going without one. One post, in part, reads: """"It is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria that can end up in your mouth & down into your lungs. I have learned that there are many harmful effects of rebreathing Carbon Dioxide (CO2)."""" Another says: """"Mask wearing reduces oxygen up to 60%. Increases risks of CO2 poisoning.

There’s no evidence that wearing masks is harmful for the general public, except for people with certain medical conditions. Carbon dioxide is a natural byproduct of the body and part of the air, and people breathe it in and out all the time. Too much CO2 can certainly be life-threatening, but only at significantly high concentrations, experts say. Hypercapnia, a condition that arises when there is too much carbon dioxide in the blood, can cause headaches, drowsiness, vertigo, double vision, disorientation, tinnitus, seizures, or suffocation due to displacement of air. CO2 makes up only about 0.04% of the air we breathe, and is considered life-threatening when its concentration is greater than about 10%. The posts don’t specify the kinds of masks or how long someone would need to wear one to generate unhealthy CO2 levels, but medical experts say the risk is quite low for the general public who wear a typical cloth or surgical mask. Linsey Marr, a professor in airborne disease transmission at Virginia Tech, said it's possible that loose fibers in the masks can be inhaled, as one post claims, but """"contaminants in these fibers would have off-gassed into the air already, unless the mask is fresh off the assembly line."""" Prolonged use of certain face masks, particularly tight-fitting medical-grade ones like the N95 respirator, can cause problems for people with respiratory illnesses. """"I don’t think that the general public wearing homemade face masks really poses a CO2 poisoning issue,"""" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told PolitiFact. """"There is data, however, that prolonged use of an N95 mask can increase blood CO2 levels, and therefore we do not recommend people wear N95 masks for a prolonged period of time. We also do not recommend the general public wear N95 masks."""" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the general public wear cloth face masks in areas where social distancing isn’t possible, and says certain medical-grade masks, like the N95, should be reserved for health care workers who are in direct contact with infected patients. The CDC also says that facial coverings should not be placed on """"young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance."""" The agency told Reuters that while CO2 that slowly builds up in masks over time, the level is mostly tolerable for people exposed to it. """"You  might get a headache but you most likely (would) not suffer the symptoms observed at much higher levels of CO2,"""" Reuters quotes the CDC as saying. """"The mask can become uncomfortable for a variety of reasons including a sensitivity to CO2, and the person will be motivated to remove the mask. It is unlikely that wearing a mask will cause hypercapnia. """"​ Dr. Thomas Tsai, a surgeon and health policy researcher at Harvard’s School of Public Health also said he hasn’t seen any credible data to support the posts. """"I wear masks every day for hours and hours at a time and I've never once suffocated and passed out from CO2,"""" Tsai said. """"On the margins we could probably find extreme cases where someone, somewhere with some condition has had an issue with a mask but that's not the average. There is absolutely no data to suggest that wearing a standard surgical or cloth mask under normal situations is deleterious to your health."""" Facebook posts say that wearing a mask causes health problems, particularly from breathing in too much exhaled carbon dioxide. There is no credible data to back that up.

Every year since Trump has been president, lawmakers have passed funding bills — which he has signed — that not only exceeded what Trump requested for emerging infections but also exceeded the previous year’s spending. As the chart below shows, funding increased every year from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2020. (We have not included the 2017 proposal, since that was submitted by the Obama administration. The figures for 2020 are preliminary.) On Feb. 24, Trump asked Congress for a $2.5 billion supplemental budget to help combat the emergence of this coronavirus. House Democrats said the amount was insufficient, and instead passed an $8.3 billion bill that Trump signed March 6. The money will fund efforts to develop a vaccine and help local governments respond to the pandemic. This needs context. """"Fired"""" is a strong term for what happened, and Trump recently created a team to lead the government’s response to COVID-19. In May 2018, Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, the senior director of global health and biodefense on the National Security Council, left the administration. He was in charge of the U.S. response to pandemics. After Ziemer’s departure, the global health team was reorganized as part of an effort by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton. Meanwhile, Tom Bossert, a homeland security adviser who recommended strong defenses against disease, left shortly after Bolton arrived. The White House didn’t replace either White House official or his team. Instead, Trump looked within his administration to fill roles for the coronavirus response. In January, Trump appointed his Health and Human Services secretary, Alex Azar, to chair a coronavirus task force. On Feb. 26, he announced that Vice President Mike Pence would take charge of the U.S. response to the coronavirus. This contains a hint of truth, but it’s mostly inaccurate. Former Vice President Joe Biden made a similar claim during the March 15 Democratic presidential debate. A March 6 Politico article says the World Health Organization shipped coronavirus tests to nearly 60 countries at the end of February, but the U.S. was not among them. That is correct, but it suggests that the U.S. would normally have been on the list, which is not the case. """"No discussions occurred between WHO and CDC about WHO providing COVID-19 tests to the United States,"""" said WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris. """"This is consistent with experience since the United States does not ordinarily rely on WHO for reagents or diagnostic tests because of sufficient domestic capacity."""" This caused a lag in testing for the virus in the U.S. The CDC’s test was different and more complicated than a test published in Germany on Jan. 17. It worked in the CDC lab, but when the materials went out to state labs, some of them got inconsistent results. The CDC had to resend packages with new chemical reagents. State laboratories started developing their own tests and were ready to use them, but had to wait for emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration. The combined delays resulted in fewer Americans being tested and a slower U.S. response overall compared with some other countries. This is inaccurate. During a Feb. 28 campaign rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump called the Democratic response to COVID-19 a """"hoax."""" But he did not use the term to describe the virus itself. During a press conference Feb. 29, Trump was asked about his remarks. """"I'm not talking about what's happening here; I'm talking what they're doing,"""" he said, referring to Democrats. """"That's the hoax."""" Trump’s comments feed into a conspiracy theory that claims Democrats and the media are fabricating the threat of COVID-19 to hurt the economy and the president’s re-election chances. And the president appeared to downplay the threat of the virus at several points in recent weeks. But to say that Trump called the virus itself a hoax is false. Plus, the administration took its first action in January by setting up a task force to address the spread of the coronavirus. An Instagram post made four claims that criticize Trump’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first, that he """"cut funding to the CDC,"""" is partially accurate; Trump tried to cut the agency’s funding, but Congress prevented it from happening. On the second claim, while saying Trump """"fired"""" the """"Pandemic Response Team"""" is a stretch, it’s true that National Security Council staffers left abruptly in 2018 and were not replaced. The third claim, that Trump """"refused WHO tests,"""" contains a hint of truth, but is mostly inaccurate since the U.S. does not usually rely on the WHO for testing protocols. And the fourth claim, which says Trump """"wasted two weeks calling this outbreak a ‘Democrat hoax,’"""" is inaccurate — the president has not called the virus itself a """"hoax,"""" just the Democrats’ response to it. As a whole, the Instagram post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""","https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-signs-8-3-billion-spending-bill-to-combat-coronavirus-11583506305, https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-homeland-security-adviser-resigns-amid-continued-turnover-in-trump-administration/2018/04/10/15db518a-3ccb-11e8-a7d1-e4efec6389f0_story.html, https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/16/joe-biden/biden-falsely-says-trump-administration-rejected-w/, https://web.archive.org/web/20200316170817/https://www.instagram.com/p/B9w7O46HJtW/, https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/mar/12/fact-checking-donald-trumps-mistakes-about-europea/, https://www.npr.org/2020/02/29/810713730/democratic-candidates-step-up-criticism-of-trumps-handling-of-coronavirus, https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/15/joe-biden/ad-watch-biden-video-twists-trumps-words-coronavir/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/02/26/congress-coronavirus-response/, https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2021/FY-2021-CDC-Budget-Detail.pdf, https://apnews.com/896611803373610849fe8602b64e181e, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/05/10/top-white-house-official-in-charge-of-pandemic-response-exits-abruptly/, https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-cdc.html, https://archive.fo/Bz2xH, https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/17/coronavirus-live-updates-us-death-toll-recession-fears-election-day/5060791002/, https://time.com/5797636/trump-botched-coronavirus-response/, https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/28/michael-bloomberg/did-donald-trump-fire-pandemic-officials-defund-cd/, https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2020/fy-2020-detail-table.pdf, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a1Mdq8-_wo, https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2018/fy-2018-cdc-budget-overview.pdf, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUNrXN9XC2k&feature=youtu.be&t=4440, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-in-us.html, https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2019/fy-2019-detail-table.pdf, https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/06/coronavirus-testing-failure-123166, https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-charleston-south-carolina-rally-transcript-february-28-2020",false,"Public Health, Facebook Fact-checks, Coronavirus, Instagram posts, "

But it didn’t declare without caveats that dental fillings are toxic, full stop.""",Ciara O'Rourke,"""Facebook users have been sharing a story that warns the U.S. Food and Drug Administration """"finally admits dental fillings are toxic."""" This post, which was published on Principia Scientific on Dec. 12, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story says that, as part of a lawsuit settlement with consumer groups, the FDA was forced to publicly admit that """"all ‘silver’ dental fillings are poisoned with mercury."""" It’s referring to dental amalgam, a filling material dentists use to fill cavities. According to the FDA, its primary component is elemental mercury. Amalgam fillings are also known as """"silver fillings"""" because of their silver-like appearance. The agency says such fillings have been used in hundreds of millions of patients around the world for over a century, and are beneficial because they’re strong and less likely to break than those made of other materials. But there are also risks. Amalgam releases low levels of mercury vapor that can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs. High levels of mercury vapor exposure can harm the brain and kidneys. The FDA says it reviewed scientific evidence to determine whether low levels of mercury vapor from dental amalgam fillings were cause for concern. Based on the evidence, according to the agency, the FDA considers them safe for adults and children 6 and older. But fetuses and young children may be more sensitive to the """"neurotoxic effects of mercury vapor,"""" according to the FDA. It says there is """"very limited to no"""" clinical data on the long-term health outcomes for pregnant women, their fetuses and young children, and advises concerned patients to talk to their dentists. The agency also discourages patients from removing their dental amalgams if they’re in good condition and there’s no tooth decay under the filling because, in part, it could expose that person to additional mercury vapor released during the removal process. Though the Principia Scientific story was published in 2018, it uses an FDA statement from 2008 to show that the agency """"was finally forced to admit"""" amalgam fillings are toxic. It was then, Reuters reported in June 2008, that the FDA settled a lawsuit with several consumer advocacy groups, including Consumers for Dental Choice and Moms Against Mercury. The group sought to ban mercury fillings from the U.S. market. As part of the settlement, according to Reuters, the FDA agreed to alert consumers about the potential risks on its website and to issue a more specific rule about fillings that contain mercury. In a notice on its website — and this is what the Principia Scientific story quotes — the FDA said that amalgams contain mercury, which may have neurotoxic effects on the nervous systems of developing children and fetuses. """"Pregnant women and persons who may have a health condition that makes them more sensitive to mercury exposure, including individuals with existing high levels of mercury microburden, should not avoid seeking dental care, but should discuss options with their health practitioner,"""" the FDA said. At the time, a lawyer for Consumers for Dental Choice described the FDA’s statement as a major shift. """"Gone, gone, gone are all of the FDA’s claims that no science exists that amalgam is unsafe,"""" he said. The Associated Press, reporting on the settlement, said that """"silver dental fillings contain mercury, and the government for the first time is warning that they may pose a safety concern for pregnant women and young children."""" It described it as a victory for """"anti-mercury activists."""" But the report also notes that the warning isn’t aimed at everybody — just two groups of people who are already urged to limit mercury from seafood because too much can harm a developing brain.

14722,"""I helped write"""" the Affordable Care Act.""","January 18, 2016","""Sanders said he """"helped write"""" the Affordable Care Act. He deserves credit for one provision of it -- worth a not-insignificant $11 billion. But overall, he was hardly an inside crafter of the bill. Until his effort was blocked by a GOP procedural move, Sanders supported a more aggressive single-payer system, and multiple news articles quoted him as being undecided about supporting the main Democratic bill until late in the process. Sanders’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. UPDATE, March 28, 2016: After we published our story, Sanders’ staff provided PolitiFact with several additional examples of provisions the senator helped insert into the Affordable Care Act, sometimes with the cooperation of other lawmakers. According to his staff, these include $1.5 billion in mandatory spending for the National Health Service Corps, a negotiated rule-making process to redefine the criteria for designating medically underserved areas, a waiver for states that want to experiment on health care policy, a provision to double penalties for health care fraud, a provision strengthening the False Claims Act, language to make volunteer ambulance personnel and firefighters who perform emergency medical services eligible for grants and loans, a provision to ease payments to alternative medicine practitioners, higher funding levels for the Public Health and Prevention Fund, and a formula increase in Medicaid funding that benefited his home state of Vermont. While this list does provide a more detailed picture of Sanders’ role in the bill’s crafting, none of these provisions involve core elements of the law, such as the exchanges and subsidies, the individual and employer mandates, the Medicaid expansion, the tax changes, the essential benefits package, and the provisions on cost containment. We stand by our original conclusion that, despite making contributions to the final legislation, Sanders was, for most of the process, an outsider pushing for a more aggressive single-payer system rather than an insider negotiating and crafting the final design of the bill. While saying that he """"helped write"""" the Affordable Care Act contains an element of truth, Sanders ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""",Louis Jacobson,"""Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sparred over health care policy during a debate in Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 17. At one point, Sanders rejected assertions by Clinton that a Sanders presidency could imperil President Barack Obama’s signature legislative initiative, the Affordable Care Act. Clinton said, """"There are things we can do to improve (the Affordable Care Act), but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction."""" Sanders countered, """"We’re not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it."""" We decided to check whether Sanders has a solid claim to have """"helped write"""" the Affordable Care Act. As our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have noted, Sanders pushed hard for a more liberal version of health care reform -- the American Health Security Act of 2009, which would have implemented a national single-payer system. (Under a single-payer system, the government, rather than private health insurers, pays all medical bills, along the lines of Medicare.) Sanders backed down after Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., used a procedural move to force a full reading of Sanders’ bill, a move that would have taken hours of floor time and imperiled passage of a more moderate bill backed by Obama and his allies. However, as negotiations were in their final stage, Sanders successfully pushed for the inclusion of $11 billion in funding for community health centers, especially in rural areas. The insertion of this funding helped bring together both Democratic lawmakers on the left and Democrats representing more conservative, rural areas. """"There was no one who played a more important role than Sen. Sanders"""" in securing that funding, Daniel Hawkins, vice president of the National Association of Community Health Centers, told the Intercept last year. (Sanders’ camp forwarded PolitiFact the Intercept article as evidence for his statement.) So there’s a good case to be made that Sanders made an important contribution to the final legislation. Still, when Sanders says he """"helped write"""" the bill, it would be reasonable to imagine that Sanders was an integral player in the crafting of the bill over a long period of time -- an insider in the process. And that’s not the reality. Before the final bill was enacted, Sanders and his allies on the party’s left flank regularly expressed frustration at the concessions they had to make during the legislative process. """"Public-option proponents, including Sanders and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, say they already have given up enough,"""" Politico reported in late November 2009. """"They agreed to forgo a single-payer system. They decided not to push a government plan tied to Medicare rates. And they accepted (Harry) Reid's proposal to include the opt-out provision. That's it, they say."""" Politico went on to quote Sanders saying, """"I have made it clear to the administration and Democratic leadership that my vote for the final bill is by no means guaranteed."""" A few weeks later, Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank reported that Sanders was still undecided on supporting the primary Democratic bill. """"I am talking to the Democratic leadership, trying my best to salvage some positive things in this bill, so I am not on board yet."""" And on Dec. 18, the New York Times quoted Sanders saying, ''I don't sleep well. I am struggling with this issue very hard, trying to sort out what is positive in this bill, what is negative in the bill, what it means for our country if there is no health insurance legislation, when we will come back to it. … And I have to combine that with the fact that I absolutely know that the insurance companies and the drug companies will be laughing all the way to the bank the day after this is passed.'' Sanders eventually voted for the legislation. Our ruling Sanders said he """"helped write"""" the Affordable Care Act. He deserves credit for one provision of it -- worth a not-insignificant $11 billion. But overall, he was hardly an inside crafter of the bill. Until his effort was blocked by a GOP procedural move, Sanders supported a more aggressive single-payer system, and multiple news articles quoted him as being undecided about supporting the main Democratic bill until late in the process.

""""Under ‘Trumpcare,’"""" U.S. Rep.

The claim by Moore, who has talked publicly about being a victim of domestic violence and sexual assault herself, cuts to one of the big fears around health care -- that having something that is considered a pre-existing condition means a person has to pay more for insurance, or could be denied coverage altogether. Typically, this refers to things such as diabetes or cancer. But sexual assault or domestic violence? Obamacare vs ‘Trumpcare’ The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is the 2010 legislation adopted under President Barack Obama. It prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage -- or charging higher premiums -- because a person has a pre-existing medical condition. Under the American Health Care Act (sometimes called """"Trumpcare""""), insurers would still be prohibited from denying coverage based on a pre-existing condition. The bill was narrowly approved by the House of Representatives and could be changed in the Senate. But in its current form, the bill would give states the option to allow insurers to charge people with pre-existing conditions higher prices. Republicans argue those people would be protected, because those states would have to set up high-risk pools to insure people with pre-existing conditions. But many analysts believe the law would still leave those people more vulnerable to cost increases that could make their plans unaffordable. (The day after the House passed the bill, GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said he would consider allowing insurers to charge higher prices. But later that day -- in an indication of how politically touchy the issue is -- he backed away from that comment after it drew criticism.) Pre-existing conditions Bloggers claimed that under the GOP bill, sexual assault is a pre-existing condition, which PolitiFact National rated . PolitiFact National spelled out what would happen under the GOP bill regarding sexual assault and experts told us that the same would apply to domestic violence. In a nutshell: The bill does not single out any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition. Conditions stemming from a sexual assault or domestic violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or certain sexually transmitted diseases, could be judged to be a pre-existing condition. States would have the option to allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with an existing condition, possibly making coverage unaffordable.

16411,Health insurance costs for Floridians are up 30 percent or more.,"September 29, 2014","The Republicans’ ad shows several unidentified people saying that health insurance costs for Floridians are up 30 percent or more. Many reports that cite big double-digit premium increases are based on individual or small-group plans and omit large group plans, the type of coverage many people have through work. Kaiser concluded that in large-group plans, the largest segment in the market, premiums will rise 3 percent. The Republicans’ ad takes anecdotal experiences about cost increases that would be rare but potentially true and creates the impression that the federal health care law is just one big heap of problems for patients without any benefits. Then it tells voters that despite that morass, Crist supports it. People may see increases to their health care costs under the law, but the typical experience is nowhere near what the ad suggests. Indeed, other Floridians will see their costs go down.",Amy Sherman,"""Got a beef with Obamacare? The Republicans want to remind voters that Democrat Charlie Crist thinks the president’s health care law is """"great."""" A TV ad by the Republican Party of Florida features anecdotes from people making claims about how the health care law has hurt them in the pocketbook or made it harder to find doctors: """"I think Obamacare harms doctors and patients."""" """"It increased my health policy, personal health policy, 30 percent."""" """"I’m disabled and I can’t find doctors that will help me."""" """"My family’s medical costs have doubled."""" """"Many doctors are losing their patients, and patients are losing their doctors. I was one of them."""" """"Obamacare hurts my ability to create jobs."""" The ad soon pivots to Crist saying of Obamacare """"I think it’s been great,"""" comments he made in a TV interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley in March 2014. Crist has campaigned in favor of the federal health care law while his opponent Republican Gov. Rick Scott has been a major critic. The ad doesn’t identify the various men and women complaining about Obamacare making it impossible to verify each individual’s experiences. State GOP spokesperson Susan Hepworth’s only reply to our questions about the people and their insurance woes: """"They are not actors."""" But we can research the ad’s overall message that the Affordable Care Act has inflated Floridians’ health care costs anywhere from 30 percent to twice as expensive. Data about rising premiums There have been various studies about average premium increases since the health care law was implemented, but the results vary widely depending on the methodology and available information. The studies we saw that cited larger increases were generally based on the individual or small-group market and not the category of large-group employer plans. Some predictions that came from Florida officials were based on a hypothetical plan that wasn’t even for sale in the state. The Republicans cited a few surveys showing higher prices. For example, a national survey by the investment firm Morgan Stanley showed Florida was seeing a 36.8 percent increase for individual plans and 20.7 percent increase for small group plans based on the response of six insurance brokers. But large-group plans were not included in the study, even though those typically represent the most commonly held form of insurance. (PolitiFact New Hampshire noted this in their state as well.) Individual plans, and to a lesser extent small-group plans, have long been expected to produce larger premium increases than large-group plans. That’s because existing individual- and small-group policies likely didn’t include many of the law’s new minimum requirements, such as preventive care with no cost-sharing. When the policies had to change, premiums were likely to rise. Larry Levitt at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading health policy research center, has said there are several reasons not to compare costs before and after Obamacare. Part of the challenge again is how policies have new coverage requirements, such as maternity care and mental health coverage. The plans people are buying in 2014 are not the same as what they may have bought last year. In 2013, Kaiser explained that overall average unsubsidized premiums for nongroup coverage would be higher because """"many people will be getting better insurance."""" Kaiser didn’t have a breakdown by state, but reported national data in September 2014 that showed average annual premiums for employer-sponsored family health coverage rose 3 percent. A 2014 Kaiser survey found that nearly half (46 percent) of those who previously bought non-group insurance and switched to a subsidized, ACA-compliant plan said their current premium is lower than it was under their previous plan, while four in 10 (39 percent) say it is higher. The rate at which those premiums changed is a question mark because of how each study measured whatever they measured, but the anonymous examples cited in the commercial sound extreme to some experts. """"While it would not be impossible for a consumer to experience a ‘30 percent increase’ in his ‘health care policy,’ that situation would unquestionably be an extreme outlier,"""" said Greg Mellowe, director of health research and analysis at the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, a consumer health advocacy group. """"The doubling of ‘medical costs’ would be even more extreme. Representing those consumers as typical Floridians would therefore be grossly misleading."""" So what are typical premium numbers? PricewaterhouseCoopers released data in August 2014 on individual market rate filings based on state insurance department rate filings and public statements. PWC found a 7.4 percent increase for Florida, a hair above the national 7 percent increase. The report cited a broad range of rate increases in some states and noted that they would likely shrink after regulators reviewed them. Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation and the White House released different information regarding premium costs in August. The Miami Herald wrote that Florida officials said rates would rise an average of 13.2 percent for new plans in the individual market next year, while the White House said most Floridians who buy an Obamacare plan will pay less in monthly premiums. How can that be? Because they’re each doing different math in order to prove their points. The Florida insurance office, an agency working for a Republican governor and GOP-led Legislature that is against the Affordable Care Act, calculated the average on individual health plans on both the private market and the health exchange, leading to that 13.2 percent rise, the Herald pointed out. The White House was only counting the second-lowest priced silver plan on the exchange in each Florida county. That method predicted an average 4 percent drop in monthly premiums. """"The bottom line is that there is absolutely no way to assess the ad without knowing where the person came from (pre-ACA insurance) and something about their health needs,"""" Caroline Pearson, a vice president at health care consulting firm Avalere, told PolitiFact Florida. """"Generally, most people in exchanges were previously uninsured or in the individual market. Most of those people will have much better coverage post ACA, but there are absolutely examples of healthy people whose costs will go up."""" Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid for President George H.W. Bush, said there still are some groups who may have seen substantial increases in their premiums. """"These are individuals or couples who had purchased individual insurance tailored to their needs and who were forced to buy more comprehensive and therefore expensive plans,"""" she said. Wilensky added that last fall there were many complaints from single people and older couples who had to buy policies with those new requirements. They didn’t need things like maternity care and full dental plans for children, but their premiums went up anyway. However, most people who have bought insurance were those who were eligible to get substantial subsidies, she said. In response to the Republicans’ ad, the Crist campaign sent reporters a copy of a recent Tampa Bay Times editorial that cited numbers that show health care reform is working in Florida -- including that nearly 1 million have elected to get a plan through the federal marketplace. Our ruling The Republicans’ ad shows several unidentified people saying that health insurance costs for Floridians are up 30 percent or more. Many reports that cite big double-digit premium increases are based on individual or small-group plans and omit large group plans, the type of coverage many people have through work. Kaiser concluded that in large-group plans, the largest segment in the market, premiums will rise 3 percent. The Republicans’ ad takes anecdotal experiences about cost increases that would be rare but potentially true and creates the impression that the federal health care law is just one big heap of problems for patients without any benefits. Then it tells voters that despite that morass, Crist supports it. People may see increases to their health care costs under the law, but the typical experience is nowhere near what the ad suggests. Indeed, other Floridians will see their costs go down.""","http://kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2014-section-one-cost-of-health-insurance/, http://www.floir.com/PressReleases/viewmediarelease.aspx?id=2070, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQWrpxjlIds, https://money.cnn.com/2013/08/06/news/economy/obamacare-premiums/, http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-numbers-show-health-reforms-are-working/2199052, http://kff.org/private-insurance/report/survey-of-non-group-health-insurance-enrollees/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t87crJPVYs&feature=youtu.be, https://www.factcheck.org/2014/04/how-not-to-use-a-survey/, https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/11/04/49-state-analysis-obamacare-to-increase-individual-market-premiums-by-avg-of-41-subsidies-flow-to-elderly/, https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/24/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-says-average-man-will-see-his-premium/, http://kff.org/health-reform/perspective/why-premiums-will-change-for-people-who-now-have-nongroup-insurance/, http://www.pwc.com/us/en/health-industries/health-research-institute/aca-state-exchanges.jhtml, http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/article1978712.html, https://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2014/may/01/americans-prosperity/afp-says-health-care-premiums-90-percent-new-hamps/, http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/nhpr/files/201404/Morgan_Stanley_Survey.pdf",false,"Health Care, Florida, Republican Party of Florida, "
10716,Bypass patients can benefit from a few drinks: study,"November 14, 2010","The biggest flaws were common ones:  Using causal language in the headline – “bypass patients can benefit from a few drinks” – for an observational study that cannot prove cause and effect; There was no discussion of the limitations of drawing conclusions from observational studies – and not a word about the potential weaknesses in a study that relied on people to fill out a questionnaire about their alcohol consumption; Using only relative figures – not absolute – to describe both benefits and harms. See our primer on this topic. Studies have been done for decades on alcohol and heart disease. This story never mentioned that long history. In 220 words, no time or space was provided for context or for an evaluation of the evidence. That’s why it got 0 stars.", ,"The cost of alcoholic drinks isn’t in question. The benefit – in terms of risk reduction – was provided only in relative risk reduction terms – 25% reduction in additional heart procedures, heart attacks or strokes. But readers should be told “25% of what?” See our primer on this topic. Most of the story focused on benefits. The story reported that “bypass patients with a condition called left ventricular dysfunction who were heavy drinkers, defined as having more than six drinks daily, were twice as likely to die from heart problems.”  But twice as likely as what? Twice as likely could mean 1 in 100 going up to 2 in 100. Was that it? Or was it 25 in 100 jumping up to 50 in 100? This is why we expect stories to quantify harms (and benefits) in absolute terms, not just relative. See our primer on this topic. It concluded with: “The American Heart Association recommends men limit themselves to two drinks a day and women to one drink a day, because too much alcohol can raise blood pressure and have other negative effects.”  But again, no information was given on the extent of blood pressure increase or on what “other negative effects” they were talking about. If it’s worth mentioning, it’s worth specifying. We’ve said before that news organizations that make causal claims about observational studies should have to write on the blackboard hundreds of times:  “Association does not equal causation.”  So using phrases like “can benefit from a few drinks” in the headline is wrong. There was no discussion of the limitations of drawing conclusions from observational studies – and not a word about the potential weaknesses in a study that relied on people to fill out a questionnaire about their alcohol consumption. Not applicable because this 220-word story didn’t really given any background on the heart conditions in question. No independent expert was quoted – only one of the researchers. The potential benefit of alcohol consumption was not compared with any other approach for reducing the risk of additional heart procedures, heart attacks or strokes in people who had bypass surgery. This could have been done with a little homework and a few more sentences. The availability of alcohol isn’t in question. We aren’t given any context of the long, long history of research looking at alcohol and heart disease. Not applicable. We can’t be sure of the extent to which the story may have relied on a news release. Only one researcher was quoted.",https://www.healthnewsreview.org/tips-for-understanding-studies.php#tip5,false,Reuters Health
22354,We don't need a separate (prescription drug) database ... Pharmacies already have a database in place.,"March 29, 2011",Freshman House member says pill mill database isn't needed because one already exists,Aaron Sharockman,"""Republicans in Tallahassee are split on whether to implement a new database that would track the sale of some prescription drugs in order to better identify and prevent doctor shopping and prescription drug abuse. The statewide drug-monitoring database would allow pharmacists and physicians to track the sale of prescription drugs and pain medication in order to prevent patients from going doctor to doctor to acquire prescriptions. Law enforcement officials could use the database to spot doctors who were over-prescribing drugs or people who are trying to abuse the system. More than 30 other states already have some type of database. Florida approved its version in 2009, but the database has been stalled over a contract dispute over what private vendor would manage the system. That has given some Republicans a chance to second-guess the program. A bill moving through the House at the behest of Speaker Dean Cannon (HB 7095) would eliminate the database. Rep. Robert Schenck, chairman of the committee that sponsored the bill, argues that the database merely tracks the problem and doesn't stop it. The House bill would instead require tracking drug wholesalers to identify unusually large distributions of narcotics. It also prohibits doctors from dispensing those medications, leaving that to pharmacists. Gov. Rick Scott, meanwhile, has said he worries the database could be an invasion of privacy, and that he doesn't want Florida taxpayers to end up on the hook for a program that was established with the promise that it would never be supported by state money. Federal grants and private fundraising efforts have generated enough money to run the database for about two years. And Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, has offered to pay $1 million to help fund the program. Scott also announced March 28 a statewide law enforcement response to try to halt criminal distribution and abuse of drugs in Florida. A freshman legislator from Pinellas County, Rep. Larry Ahern, wrote a letter to the editor of the St. Petersburg Times with another reason to oppose the database: Florida already has one. Ahern, who runs a swimming pool remodeling business, was responding to an editorial from the Times urging Republicans to move forward with the database. """"The Florida House has it right, and the Times gets it wrong,"""" he wrote in a letter published March 25, 2011. """"Pharmacies already have a database in place, and the transaction is recorded on the spot. They will question the person trying to fill another prescription so quickly, and not fill it or call the doctor. """"We don't need a separate database with one already in place. The House bill will close pill mills without hurting legitimate doctors' ability to help their patients."""" Is the database that's caused such a fight in the Legislature overkill? Lori Weems, a lobbyist for the Florida Pharmacy Association, suggested we call a pharmacist to find out. Ron Haines, a licensed pharmacist since 1961 who works at an independent pharmacy in Tarpon Springs, told us there is no database like the one Ahern is suggesting. """"I can't call the pharmacy across the street to ask if they filled a prescription for Mike Smith. They can't tell me."""" Records are kept by pharmacies, of course, but those records aren't shared, Haines said. Every pharmacy keeps a record of what they prescribe to patients, Haines said, and pharmacy chains like Walgreens, CVS and Publix link into company databases. So a Publix pharmacist might know how many times a customer has been to a Publix pharmacy, and for what. But the Walgreens database doesn't sync into the CVS database, or vice versa. Insurance companies also keep databases on their patients to track what insurance companies are being ask to help pay for. But none of those databases were created with the idea of trying to find people -- doctors or patients -- who are abusing the system, Haines said. """"The databases we use store prescription records in the pharmacy. That's as far as it goes,"""" he said. """"There is nothing aimed at targeting bad doctors and doctor shopping. That's what we're after."""" Michael Jackson, CEO of the Florida Pharmacy Association, told us the same thing. """"It is true that many of the major chain pharmacies have prescription databases that are shared under their corporate umbrella pharmacies however they are not interconnected with other pharmacies,"""" Jackson said. """"For example I may be a pharmacist working at chain """"A"""" and a patient brings in their prescription to me. I cannot determine if that patient had a prescription filled at my competitor chain """"B"""" located across the street that same day. In many cases I may ask the patient to provide me with their medication history and who has been their pharmacy providers but they may either not remember or for some reason elect to withhold that information from me."""" Ahern, in an interview, more or less conceded the point. He said what he was trying to suggest is that the state should explore ways to have the big pharmacies connect the already in-place databases together in a way that would allow law enforcement and pharmacists to look for trouble spots. He said using infrastructure already in place is better than creating a new system from scratch. """"That would, in essence, solve much of the problems,"""" he said. Ahern also pointed out flaws in the statewide monitoring program -- namely that health care practitioners would not be required to access the database before prescribing anyone medicine. And that pharmacists have 15 days to enter drug purchases into the system. """"Where does that solve the problem?"""" Ahern asked. Ahern, for the record, is worried about privacy concerns in the database, and says he supports efforts to quell doctor-shopping. But he just doesn't think the statewide database is an effective tool in that fight. He also claimed in his letter to the editor that a database already is in place. There are many private-sector databases that collect information on prescription drug purchases, but those databases are not interconnected and were not created with the idea of reducing prescription drug abuse statewide. These individual store or company databases don't address the problem.""","http://drugcontrol.flgov.com/pdmp/faq.html, http://www.tampabay.com/news/health/florida-senate-draws-battle-lines-to-preserve-prescription-drug-monitoring/1157294, http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=46705, http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/letters/fridays-letters-allow-doctors-to-discuss-safety/1159472",false,"Drugs, Health Care, Public Health, Florida, Larry Ahern, "

A moderator kicked off the exchange by noting that TV ads in the race had made several claims about possible changes to Medicare and where the candidates stood on those changes. Pryor was asked, """"What specifically would you change about the current system, if anything?"""" Pryor answered by parrying a charge that he had voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare by voting for Obamacare. (We have rated Cotton’s earlier claim that Pryor """"cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare"""" by $700 billion Half True.) In fact, Pryor said that Cotton """"has voted for that very same $700 billion (cut) he loves to criticize me for."""" (We rated a close variation of that claim True.) When given an opportunity to respond, Cotton took the questioner’s claim head-on. Cotton said, """"The answer to your question is: I will make no changes to the current (Medicare) system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement."""" We wondered if that was what his platform really shows. The answer hinges on two separate questions. First, Does Cotton support repeal of Obamacare? And second, if Obamacare is repealed, would that prompt changes to Medicare either for current retirees or people approaching retirement? The short answers are yes and yes. Here are the more detailed explanations. Does Cotton support the repeal of Obamacare? Cotton’s staff didn’t return an inquiry from PolitiFact, but we found lots of examples of Cotton arguing that Obamacare should be repealed. • """"I will fight to repeal and replace Obamacare with free-market reforms that empower patients and doctors to make health-care decisions. … Obamacare must be repealed entirely."""" -- Cotton’s House of Representatives office website, accessed Oct. 15, 2014. • I """"will fight to repeal Obamacare."""" -- Cotton’s Facebook page, accessed Oct. 15, 2014. • """"What we have to do is repeal Obamacare, start over, and get it right."""" -- Cotton at a press conference with former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, Aug 21, 2014. • """"We would repeal Obamacare and replace it entirely with many reforms for our health care program."""" -- Cotton at a press conference, April 13, 2014 • And most clearly, a pledge Cotton signed that says, """"I pledge to vote for all bills which seek to REPEAL the health care bill, HR 3590, signed into law on March 23, 2010. To that end, I do now and will in the next Congress endorse and vote for all measures, including discharge petitions, leading to its defunding, deauthorization, and repeal. I shall do so whether those measures are taken for the whole of the bill or those component parts that impose mandates, restrict patient and doctor choice and access, violate individual freedom and privacy, reduce healthy competition, increase costs, or raise taxes."""" It’s worth noting that, at times, Cotton has expressed a desire to """"replace"""" the newly repealed law with something else. However, we’ve failed to uncover an instance in which Cotton provided a detailed description of the Medicare policies that would be reinstated after a repeal. Cotton has also expressed an openness to more limited efforts, such as defunding the law, if a repeal can’t be achieved. Still, it’s clear from these comments that repeal is his first choice. Bottom line: Yes, Cotton has said consistently that he wants to repeal the law. If Obamacare is repealed, would that prompt changes to Medicare for current beneficiaries? It would. The highest-profile element of the law that would disappear in the event of a full repeal is the closing of the """"doughnut hole."""" The law made strides to ease the previous, longstanding gap in coverage for beneficiaries in which they weren’t able to get government subsidies for prescription drug purchases under Medicare Part D. However, this isn’t the only example of a benefit included in the Affordable Care Act that would disappear for those currently on Medicare if the law is repealed and replacement provisions aren’t specifically enacted. Here are others, gleaned from the Kaiser Family Foundation’s summary of the health care law: • Elimination of cost-sharing for Medicare-covered preventive services. • Authorization of Medicare coverage of """"personalized prevention plan services,"""" including an annual, comprehensive health-risk assessment. • Incentives to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries to complete behavior-modification programs, such as smoking cessation. • Reduction in the out-of-pocket amount that qualifies an enrollee for catastrophic coverage for prescriptions. • Expansion of Medicare coverage to individuals who have been exposed to environmental health hazards from living in an area subject to an emergency declaration made as of June 17, 2009, and have developed certain health conditions as a result. • Prohibition of Medicare Advantage plans from imposing higher cost-sharing requirements for some Medicare-covered benefits than is required under the traditional fee-for-service program. In other words, current Medicare beneficiaries would feel a significant impact if a replacement law is not forthcoming after a repeal. We see no evidence that Cotton has pledged to protect any of these specific provisions in the wake of a repeal. Our ruling Cotton said that under his platform, he """"will make no changes to the current (Medicare) system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement."""" Cotton has consistently supported repeal of Obamacare, and while he has sometimes noted that something needs to be enacted to """"replace"""" the law, we couldn’t find any examples in which he specifically pledged to protect the Medicare policies that would be eliminated if the law was repealed, such as the closing of the doughnut hole and free preventive health-care services.""","https://www.facebook.com/TomCottonAR/info?ref=page_internal, http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2014/08/21/mitt-romney-endorses-tom-cotton, https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/19/tom-cotton/sen-mark-pryor-cut-medicare-pay-obamacare-says-rep/, http://www.medicare.gov/pubs/pdf/11493.pdf, http://cotton.house.gov/issues/health-issues, https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/15/stephanie-cutter/ryans-plan-includes-700-billion-medicare-cuts-says/, http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2014/04/13/tom-cotton-avoids-taking-stance-on-private-option, http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2014/10/14/tom-cotton-absolutely-refuses-to-answer-questions-about-the-200000-arkansans-on-the-private-option-who-would-lose-coverage-if-obamacare-repea, http://kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/summary-of-the-affordable-care-act/, http://www.therepealpledge.com/status/full-list-of-signers/, https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/gop-rep-tom-cotton-obamacare-repeals-not-gonna-probably-work#ax2xfr, http://www.katv.com/story/26786800/pryor-cotton-live-debate-on-katv",false,"National, Health Care, Medicare, Retirement, Tom Cotton, "
9956,New U.S. analysis backs annual breast screening,"January 26, 2011","This story reports on a new analysis of the scientific evidence used by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to make its 2009 recommendations regarding mammography screening. The authors of the analysis, published online by the American Journal of Roentgenology, arrived at different conclusions than the Task Force’s recommendations. But the story didn’t include any sense of how the new analysis was done or why its conclusions were different. There was no analysis of whether the new analysis took a reasonable approach. That’s what women needed in order to understand the story. The Task Force’s 2009 recommendations generated a lot of controversy. This new analysis is the first to use the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network to further examine the evidence used by the USPSTF. But this story did not provide strong or compelling data to help readers evaluate or compare the quality of the two analyses. And it did not present both sides of this controversy.", ,"The piece does not include any discussion of the financial, physical, or emotional costs of beginning routine mammography screening at age 40, which the authors of the new analysis see as necessary. The financial costs of overdiagnosis are significant for both the individual diagnosed and for society. The article does not include information about the increased number of false positives that will result from annual screening beginning at age 40 or about the significant physical and emotional costs of false positives. The article is dismissive of these harms. From the article it is not clear whether the new analysis considered any of these harms or was solely based on breast cancer mortality. Recommendations about mammography screening beginning at age 40 have been controversial at least since the 1990s. Because of this history of controversy and women’s fear of breast cancer, the framing of a story about screening mammography is especially important. This article frames the new analysis in a totally favorable way and includes two significant inaccuracies. First, the article states that “…annual mammograms save 65,000 more women from breast cancer.”  Mammograms do not prevent breast cancer. Their purpose is to detect breast cancer. Second, the article includes a misleading relative risk reduction by stating that beginning mammography at age 40 “…cuts…risk of dying from breast cancer by 71%.”  The study calculated mortality reduction for annual mammograms beginning at age 40 at 39.6% versus 23.2% according to the USPSTF recommendation. The article does not include information about the potential harms resulting from routine, annual mammography beginning at age 40. Readers, especially women who may decide to begin annual screening at age 40, need to be told about the possibility of false positives and unnecessary biopsies. Authors such as Welch and Esserman have referred to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The article does not adequately describe how results of the new analysis were generated or provide the reader with any way to compare how or why this model differed from the one used by the USPSTF. Explaining some of the assumptions used that led to different results would be helpful for readers. While the article does not exaggerate the incidence of breast cancer, it does state that “annual mammograms save 65,000 more women from breast cancer.”  This could lead women to believe that mammography prevents breast cancer when its purpose is to detect breast cancer. Incorrect and misleading. . The only independent source quoted in the article is the chair of the Breast Imaging Commission of the American College of Radiology. This source would be biased toward recommending more frequent screening. The article should also have included reactions from members of the USPSTF or from groups that supported the recommendations of the Task Force. The article does not mention that one author of the analysis is a consultant to GE Healthcare, a major manufacturer of mammography equipment. The other author of the analysis has received grant support from GE Healthcare. The article fails to mention the disadvantages of annual mammography screening beginning at age 40. By not including balanced information, the article may lead readers to believe this new analysis is totally accurate. The choice of declining screening was not presented as a reasonable option. Not applicable. There’s no question about the availability of mammograms. The article does note that it is reporting on a new analysis of evidence that was also used by the USPSTF when it determined its 2009 mammography screening recommendations. The article does not adequately explain why this new analysis arrived at different conclusions than the USPSTF. By failing to do this, the article does not provide readers with sufficient information to judge the new analysis. The story does not rely on a news release.

The Lie of the Year in 2010 debunked statements that suggested the Affordable Care Act represented a """"government takeover of health care."""" The main finding was that the plan would increase government regulation, but it would continue to rely on private insurers to provide coverage for most Americans. Beruff’s claim falls into a similar trap because it glazes over private insurers’ roles, but doesn’t go as far as to suggest a government takeover. The individual mandate Beruff’s spokesperson cited the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which requires most individuals to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty, called the individual shared responsibility payment. That mandate, which took effect in 2014, is due every month an individual doesn’t have health insurance that meets the minimum essential coverage. The penalty is assessed on tax returns, and increases every year a person remains uninsured. No one is forced to buy government health insurance via the individual mandate, but individuals are strongly incentivized to have the minimum essential health coverage to avoid the penalty. Some may consider the individual mandate to be """"forcing"""" people to get coverage, but people can choose to remain without health insurance and defer to the fine, said Ben Sommers, an assistant professor of health and economics at the Harvard T.H. School of Public Health. Beruff’s point isn’t flat-out wrong, but his word choice is problematic, said Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush. She said she wouldn’t have used the word """"forced"""" because the mandate only strongly encourages having health care coverage, and it doesn’t have to be government coverage if your employer offers private insurance. The individual mandate has many exemptions depending on income, membership in groups like Indian tribes, and incarceration. If individuals don’t fall into those categories, the Health Insurance Marketplace lays out 14 categories of hardship exemptions that exempt people from the financial penalty if they cannot afford it. """"Hardship"""" exemptions cover homelessness, filing for bankruptcy and foreclosure, and a family member’s death, to name a few examples. Dissecting ‘government health care’ Beruff’s bigger problem is with his characterization of the Affordable Care Act as """"government health care."""" Yes, the mandate requires Americans to carry health insurance. But just as before the law, the majority obtain it from private sources, such as their employer or from choosing plans offered in health insurance marketplaces set up by federal or state regulators. The law aimed to dramatically expand public health insurance through the federal-state Medicaid program. But a Supreme Court decision has allowed 20 states, including large ones such as Texas and Florida, to not extend coverage to more low-income residents using federal dollars. In 2014, 66 percent of people had private health insurance, and 55 percent of all people received insurance from their employers, according to a report from the Census Bureau. Any type of private health insurance must meet specific set of rules in the essential benefit package, said Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. But it’s still private, not government health care. Still, Tanner said it might be fair to call the coverage """"government designated health care"""" because individuals can’t buy just any type of health insurance, he said. Beruff’s spokesperson echoed this argument. Our ruling Beruff said Washington politicians are """"already forcing you to buy government health care.""""

Gary Peters (D-Mich.), who is running for a second term as Michigan’s junior senator, is the subject of an attack ad that takes issue with his position on """"Medicare for All."""" The ad claims that """"Peters supports Medicare for All, siding with radical liberals."""" But Peters’ legislative record and public statements suggest otherwise. One Michigan advocate for this single-payer approach even said Peters has never been a part of their cause. The ad aired on TV stations across the state starting Dec. 12 and was funded by Better Future Michigan. Initially, the commercial was pulled from some airways after being challenged by the Peters’ campaign for """"being objectively and unquestionably ."""" Better Future Michigan updated and re-released the ad Dec. 16, saying Peters """"supported"""" rather than """"endorsed"""" Medicare for All, and ran it through Dec. 20. The commercial drew our interest ― not only because of the questions it triggered about Peters’ position on health reform, but also because it highlights how the debate over Medicare for All could play out in races ranging from the presidential campaign to House and Senate contests. A matter of ‘he said, she said’ We started out by checking with Better Future Michigan, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit group, to find out the basis for the ad. (Under IRS rules, 501 (c)(4) groups do not have to disclose their donors.) Tori Sachs, its executive director, pointed to two videos from a 2018 town hall meeting, featuring an exchange between Peters and a voter who supports the single-payer approach to health reform. Peters responded by saying he wants to protect the Affordable Care Act from Republicans and introduce a public option in the insurance exchange. But Peters also said: """"The path forward is where you’re going to have Medicare for All down the road. That’s probably where we’re going to go. But we’ve got to deal with the problem we have right now."""" This statement, according to Sachs, is central to Better Future Michigan’s position. """"If Peters is (or was) so staunchly against Medicare for All, why did he acknowledge that it’s the future?"""" she wrote in an email. """"Someone opposed to an issue or policy would at minimum qualify such a statement, but instead, Peters’ surrounding discussion with the town hall participant shows otherwise."""" (Sachs managed John James’ failed 2018 challenge to unseat Michigan’s senior Democratic senator, Debbie Stabenow. James is now running against Peters.) An April 2019 press release from the National Republican Senatorial Committee advanced a similar argument, saying Peters is """"playing both sides"""" of the Medicare for All debate. The Peters campaign pushed back. """"This dark money group with close ties to John James is pushing objectively  claims in their attack ads in a desperate attempt to lie to Michigan voters. Senator Peters’ position has been clear and consistent that he supports strengthening the Affordable Care Act and expanding access to health insurance through common sense policies like adding a public option and letting people 50 and older buy into Medicare but does not support Medicare for All or eliminating private health insurance,"""" said Dan Farough, Peters’ campaign manager, in an email. The campaign also provided several articles in which the senator shied away from supporting Medicare for All. In an August 2019 interview with Politico, when asked if Medicare for All proponents could win his state, Peters said they would """"have to show and be able to explain exactly how that would help folks here in Michigan,"""" and """"I think people do want to have the opportunity to keep private insurance."""" His position appeared consistent in other press reports, too, ranging from Michigan TV interviews to a CNN article. Peters generally voiced his support for shoring up the Affordable Care Act, offering a public option on the insurance marketplace and lowering the eligibility age for Medicare. In 2019, he co-sponsored a bill that would allow anyone over 50 to buy into Medicare and another bill that would establish a public health plan option on the insurance exchange. Peters has not co-sponsored Sanders’ Medicare for All legislation. Eli Rubin, president of the advocacy group Michigan for Single Payer Healthcare, said that Peters """"definitely does not support Medicare for All,"""" but that he also doesn’t like to take a position or directly answer questions about it. """"We’ve had many encounters with him and asked him about it, and he won’t say, ‘No, out of the question,’ but he dodges the question every time,"""" said Rubin. """"He turns the conversation every time to where he talks about his defense of the Affordable Care Act."""" Marianne Udow-Phillips, the director of the nonpartisan Center for Health and Research Transformation at the University of Michigan, offered another take. """"What he is trying to do is not foreclose strategies, but to essentially say that is not his area of focus on health care right now,"""" she said. """"Michigan is like the rest of the country,"""" said Udow-Phillips. """"People are primarily concerned with the cost of health care and pocketbook issues. They’re worried about deductibles and copays. They’re worried about surprise bills. I don’t think on a statewide basis Medicare for All is a motivating issue or speaks to people in a broad way."""" Still, pollsters and policy experts point out that for some voters in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party support for Medicare for All can become a litmus test. Why there’s such a fuss With the 2020 election fast approaching, there’s a sense among some Democrats in Michigan and other battleground states that supporting progressive issues like Medicare for All could translate into political baggage on the campaign trail. """"Independents and swing voters are more negative against Medicare for All,"""" said Robert Blendon of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who is an expert on public opinion of social policy. For instance, 65% of swing voters in Michigan said a national Medicare for All plan that would eliminate private health insurance is a bad idea, according to a November 2019 Kaiser Family Foundation poll. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) The issue can also be weaponized against Democratic candidates. Colleen Grogan, a professor at the University of Chicago’s School of Social Service Administration, pointed out that it is a common GOP strategy to associate Medicare for All with socialized medicine. It can also be used to play on the public’s lack of confidence in government-run social programs, she added. """"The whole idea is that the government is such a demon in the U.S.,"""" said Grogan. """"It’s easy for Republicans to demonize the government … and say, ‘You don’t want them [the government] running your health care program.’"""" Another benefit of this attack method, which could be used frequently in the run-up to November, according to Blendon, is that it doesn’t require the GOP to offer a policy alternative and instead focuses on how Medicare for All would eliminate private insurance. """"From the Republican point of view, it doesn’t require you to take a stand on what you’ll do for health care,"""" he said. """"But it does allow you to say, you won’t have any choice in your health care."""" Our ruling A TV ad by Better Future Michigan claimed that Peters """"supports Medicare for All, siding with radical liberals."""" The statement is based on two videos from a 2018 town hall meeting. Though the senator does not tell a Medicare for All supporter that he backs this approach, he agreed that it could be a """"pathway"""" in the future. But from this comment to the ad’s overall assertion is a big stretch. Specifically, Peters is on the record as supporting efforts to protect the Affordable Care Act from Republican changes, offering a public option and lowering the eligibility age for Medicare. He also supports keeping private insurance. In addition, he is not a co-sponsor of Sanders’ Medicare for All legislation, and single-payer advocates within Michigan said he """"definitely"""" does not support this approach.""","https://www.kff.org/person/ashley-kirzinger/, https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/25/democrats-health-care-senate-1678301, https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/29/politics/kamala-harris-medicare-for-all-divides-democrats/index.html, http://ssa.uchicago.edu/ssascholars/c-grogan, https://app.criticalmention.com/app/#clip/view/c50dc93e-7d60-453e-b3d6-1a1ca148ab8f?token=3b89016e-3429-4cc0-a47a-13d9cec7884f, https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/11/how-democrats-won-big-michigan-midterms/576043/, https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/981, https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2019/12/michigan-tv-stations-replace-false-attack-ads-on-gary-peters.html, https://www.kff.org/slideshow/public-opinion-on-single-payer-national-health-plans-and-expanding-access-to-medicare-coverage/, https://www.nrsc.org/blog/gary-peters-is-hiding-from-medicare-for-all-2019-04-12/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q9HVsRFB28, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJEYTynefg4&feature=emb_logo, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h24ckbTP9fA&feature=youtu.be, https://www.nrsc.org/press-releases/nrsc-targets-gary-peters-on-medicare-for-all-during-bernie-sanders-rally-2019-04-13/, https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1129/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded&KWICView=false, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfAv5r4trHE&feature=youtu.be, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWeEQJt8gnA, https://chrt.org/bio/marianne-udow-phillips/, https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/robert-blendon/, https://www.michigan4singlepayer.org/, https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/470, https://twitter.com/BetterFutureMI/status/1206603407613673472, https://www.kff.org/report-section/blue-wall-voices-project-michigan/",false,"Health Care, Health Check, Better Future Michigan, "
37083,Fruits and vegetables from other countries are being contaminated with blood containing either AIDS or HIV.,"March 17, 2015",Were Blood Oranges from Libya Injected with HIV?,  Rich Buhler & Staff  ,"A popular rumor about oranges or bananas from outside the United States being injected with HIV- or AIDS-contaminated blood seems to circulate endlessly on social media despite having no basis in reality.This seems to be a spin on the popular (and completely unfounded) “foreigners carry diseases” myth that seems to be part of any immigration backlash.A similar version of the eRumor reports that canned fruit was found to be contaminated with HIV-positive blood.The Truth:Various reports of HIV-positive blood being found in oranges and canned fruit have persisted for years, but there’s no truth to these claims.Even if these accounts were true, it would be nearly impossible to contract HIV from eating an orange that was injected with infected blood before it was shipped over a long distance.HIV is a living virus, and it needs a human host to survive, the nonprofit group Aid for AIDS  reports:HIV is a very fragile virus outside of the body. The HIV virus needs the human body as its host. The life span of HIV outside of the body has not been determined. However, we know that HIV needs its host cell (a human), the body temperature, and the chemistry of the blood to survive. Out of the body, HIV is out of its environment. As the blood dries, the HIV will die. In areas like a syringe or on a razor in a medicine cabinet, HIV would probably live longer because of less airflow and it’s a more moist temperature controlled area.“Just remember, outside of the body HIV can’t survive. In minutes it will die and be harmless, but Universal Precautions should always be used.”Social media has lit up with  reports that oranges exported from Libya were injected with blood that tested positive for HIV or AIDS. The posts show photos of halved oranges with red coloration inside similar to blood. A caption reads:“The immigration services of Algeria recovered a large quantity of these oranges coming from Libya. These oranges were injected with positive tested HIV and AIDS blood.”The publication Yemen Now used the same photos and reported that the oranges had been injected with hepatitis B and HIV-positive blood. In that version, the oranges were shipped from Egypt into neighboring countries. A translated photo caption reads:Where did the meanness and hostility against Arabs and Muslims by the Zionists and their agents (come from? )In reality, the oranges in the pictures weren’t injected with HIV, AIDS or hepatitis B-positive blood. The photos likely show the inside of an  unripe blood orange, or the inside of a blood orange hybrid (no real blood included. )Another variation of the eRumor claims that HIV-positive blood was found inside canned fruit from Thailand, which is also untrue. The Thai government responded directly to the claim and  said it was false.This rumor continues to be false regardless which country is named.","https://danitzh.deviantart.com/art/Blood-Orange-unripened-202884699, https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/transmission.html, https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblood-oranges-from-libya-were-injected-with-hiv-blood%2F, http://yemennow.net/news390100.html, https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Were+Blood+Oranges+from+Libya+Injected+with+HIV%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblood-oranges-from-libya-were-injected-with-hiv-blood%2F&via=erumors, https://www.truthorfiction.com/brian-kolfage-letter-to-obama/, https://www.truthorfiction.com/author/truthorfiction/, https://www.avert.org/infographics/you-cant-get-hiv-eating-fruit, https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblood-oranges-from-libya-were-injected-with-hiv-blood%2F, https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/immigration-border-crisis/vectors-or-victims-docs-slam-rumors-migrants-carry-disease-n152216, https://www.truthorfiction.com/category/fact-checks/, https://www.truthorfiction.com/avian-flu-turkeys/, https://www.truthorfiction.com/category/health-medical/, https://www.facebook.com/zambianeye/photos/pb.299559556743493.-2207520000.1424903599./929624847070291/?type=1, https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv-aids/fact-sheets/20/48/the-basics-of-hiv-prevention, http://www.brudirect.com/national/national/national-headlines/5549-embassy-debunks-rumours-of-hiv-tainted-products, https://www.truthorfiction.com/category/fact-checks/disinformation/, https://www.truthorfiction.com/category/fact-checks/politics/, https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblood-oranges-from-libya-were-injected-with-hiv-blood%2F, https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblood-oranges-from-libya-were-injected-with-hiv-blood%2F, http://www.afanlv.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=89:how-long-does-the-virus-live-outside-the-body&catid=35&Itemid=146, https://www.truthorfiction.com/category/fact-checks/viral-content/",false,"Disinformation, Fact Checks, Health / Medical, Politics, Viral Content"
26335,"Regarding the risks of coronavirus transmission on an airplane, “It’s as safe as an environment as you’re going to find.”","May 11, 2020","Studies show that infectious disease transmission can occur on airplanes, particularly if you are seated next to someone who is carrying an illness. Some research suggests that airplanes’ highly effective ventilation systems make them safer than other enclosed modes of transportation, like subways. But it is difficult to maintain social distancing on an airplane — especially compared with being at home, in an office or at a grocery store.",Victoria Knight,"""During an appearance on """"Face the Nation,"""" Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said that he believed it was safe for Americans to fly during the coronavirus epidemic and that a plane is as safe as any other space. """"I don’t think the risk on an airplane is any greater risk than anywhere else, and in fact, you just look at the layered approach that we use. It’s as safe as an environment as you’re going to find,"""" said Kelly. We thought it was important to check this claim. After all, as states lift stay-at-home orders and summer weather starts to roll in, Americans are bound to start thinking about travel and whether it’s safe to fly in the COVID age. We contacted Southwest Airlines to ask for the evidence to back up Kelly’s claim. A company spokesperson pointed us to this statement -- the Southwest Promise – which outlines steps taken by the airline to protect employees and customers from COVID-19. The spokesperson also said that all of Southwest’s flights are equipped with HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters, which also are used in hospitals to provide patients with clean air. All in all, it seems Kelly has some valid points about the safety of airplanes right now. But he also overplayed his hand. So, how might someone contract COVID-19 on a plane? As with any setting that holds many people at the same time, there is a risk of virus transmission through the air as well as from high-touch surfaces. On an airplane, that could be a bathroom door handle. And it is easy to picture how this risk can be amplified on a long flight with other travelers. Case studies have shown that disease transmission occurs on flights. In 2003, for instance, 16 people tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS – a coronavirus closely related to COVID, after flying on a plane with a symptomatic passenger. The H1N1 virus, or swine flu, has also been documented as having spread between plane passengers. COVID-specific research is ongoing. There are specific issues concerning air travel. Qingyan Chen, a professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University who led Federal Aviation Administration-sponsored research examining infectious disease transmission on airplanes, said his team focused on certain specific ways an illness could spread on an aircraft: by direct contact with sick person, and by inhaling large droplets or aerosols expelled from a sick person. Large droplets are caused by forcing air out of your mouth, such as by breathing, talking, coughing or sneezing. A lot of the droplets are too large to stay airborne long, while others are very small and can stay airborne for hours. The small droplets are called aerosols. Though the air in an airplane is highly circulated, Chen said aerosols can still hang in the air for about three to four minutes before being sucked up by the ventilation system. Aerosols """"can be really dangerous. They have the highest risk,"""" said Chen. """"The small droplets can get to the seven rows around a sick passenger within four minutes."""" However, Chen was quick to point out that his studies were focused on other airborne diseases, like flu, tuberculosis and SARS. Airlines maintain that there is little evidence that COVID-19 transmission has occurred on planes and that their ventilation systems are 99.9% effective at filtering out microscopic particles. There are also studies that suggest aerosols have a more limited reach, just two seats laterally and one row in front of and one row behind an infectious passenger. The International Air Transport Association, which represents 290 airlines from 120 countries, sent us details of a May 5 presentation by the group’s medical adviser in which he referred to three """"studies"""" — actually two academic journal research letters and a news article — that showed little or no transmission of COVID-19 on flights that contained passengers who had the coronavirus. One of the letters, though, discussed a case in which a person flew from the Central African Republic to France and """"likely got infected on the plane."""" """"The research that’s been done over the years is that there’s really not any significant difference in what you would have in a building such as we’re sitting in today, in terms of air quality,"""" FAA chief Steve Dickson said at a March Capitol Hill hearing. Airlines for America, a U.S.-focused industry trade group, said the industry is """"taking substantial, proactive steps to protect passengers and employees,"""" including requiring that passengers and employees wear masks, implementing intensive cleaning protocols and changing policies such as the boarding of passengers from back to front and the reduced frequency of food and beverage services. (Kelly is on the board of directors for Airlines for America.) But is that enough to justify Kelly’s statement that airplanes are as safe as just about any other environment? Not really. The key difference is that you are able to make decisions about how much space to put between yourself and other people in almost all other locations, said Karen Hoffmann, the immediate past president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. """"There are levels of what you can and can’t do in an airplane,"""" said Hoffmann. """"If you’re in your home, you can maintain no one else coming into your space. In the grocery store you can walk away from other people."""" Chen agreed. """"In offices, you have ample space to stay far apart and keep your social distancing,"""" he said. """"But in the airplane, you cannot keep your social distance or else the airliners will not be profitable."""" How do the infection-transmission risks of airplanes hold up in comparison with other modes of mass transportation? """"Compared to more cramped and less ventilated settings like subways and buses, the risks of getting sick on an airplane are lower overall — though you still face risk from whatever infections the people in your row may be carrying,"""" wrote Rachel Vreeman in an email. She is the director of the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine. But the research on this comparison predates COVID-19 and the impact of social distancing. The longer average length of time passengers spend on airplanes versus mass transit could also make it less safe, Vreeman added. With all of those factors taken into account, Kelly’s statement unravels. Is an airplane potentially carrying an infectious passenger safer than your own home, where the only contact with a stranger you have is grabbing the takeout dinner order left on your porch by a delivery person? Clearly not. It’s clear that airlines do carry a transmission risk for illnesses like COVID-19, especially if you end up seated close to an infectious person. And people have less control over social distancing on airplanes than in other spaces. Overall, Chen said he thought it could be reasonably safe as long as every passenger and crew member wore a mask. He also suggested that passengers wipe down the surfaces around them and wash their hands, but said there would still be a risk. In late April, unions representing pilots and flight attendants sent letters to the U.S. Transportation Department , the Department of Health and Human Services, Congress and the White House detailing the risks faced by airline workers — as well as the number of infections and even deaths they have suffered — and urging increased safety protections. Shortly after, most major U.S. airlines, including JetBlue, Frontier, American, Delta, United and Southwest, announced they would now require customers to wear face masks during check-in and boarding, in flight and while deplaning. Hoffmann said that for a flight to be safe it would be crucial for social distancing rules to be in place, such as blocking out seats to space out travelers. """"Can you maintain that level of separation in an airplane?"""" she asked. """"I question whether that is something which can be accomplished."""" Delta has started blocking out its middle seats. Some airlines are blocking the seats near where the flight attendants sit. United is not allowing customers to select seats next to each other or the middle seats. Both Southwest and JetBlue have said they will limit the number of passengers to ensure space between them. Vreeman pointed out, though, that there are times on an airplane or in an airport where it might be impossible to maintain the appropriate distance from others. """"When someone is walking in the aisle to the bathroom, for example, you might be stuck in close proximity — and that would increase the risks to both of you,"""" she wrote. And while all major U.S. airlines have announced increased efforts to disinfect and sanitize planes and eliminate or reduce food and beverage service, there is still a danger. """"Any time you are removing your mask or putting anything in your mouth, the risk of transmitting or being exposed to the virus will be higher,"""" wrote Vreeman. And, Vreeman argued, we are still in the containment stage of the pandemic, which means moving from one place to another is itself a public health risk. """"At this moment in American history, it is still very possible that someone infected with this very contagious virus could be in that space on the airplane with you — or that you could be carrying the virus yourself to a new location,"""" she wrote. The CEO of Southwest Airlines said during a TV interview that the risks of COVID-19 transmission on an airplane are no greater than anywhere else and that """"it’s as safe as an environment as you’re going to find."""" Research shows that airplanes’ strong ventilation systems do filter out virus particles. However, studies also indicate that some level of risk regarding the transmission of an infectious disease persists, particularly if you are seated near a contagious person. And passengers’ ability to take steps to mitigate that risk is limited. Kelly’s statement contained an element of truth regarding planes’ air filtration and mitigation steps taken by the industry, but he took it a bit too far and left out key pieces of information and context.""","http://www.alpa.org/-/media/ALPA/Files/pdfs/news-events/letters/042420-letter-to-USG-leaders.pdf, https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00974-w, https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/is-it-safe-to-fly-coronavirus, https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=benjamin-lopman-8568, https://www.afar.com/magazine/face-masks-now-required-provided-on-these-us-airlines, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-by-air-land-sea/air-travel, https://www.southwest.com/promise/?irgwc=1&clickid=0cww0pyOIxyORw6wUx0Mo38QUkizoTxhRWXH380, https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-can-become-aerosol-doesnt-mean-doomed/, https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/afacwa/pages/2667/attachments/original/1587675776/4-23-2020_AFA_PPE_Letter_DOT_HHS_FINAL.pdf?1587675776%20style=, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24377724/, https://www.cbsnews.com/news/full-transcript-of-face-the-nation-on-may-3-2020/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/scientists-think-they-know-ways-to-combat-viruses-on-airplanes-theyre-too-late-for-this-pandemic/2020/04/20/83279318-76ab-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html, https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/03/25/coronavirus-southwest-delta-american-reduce-food-drink-services/5077902002/, https://apic.org/about-apic/leadership/karen-hoffmann/, http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/American-Airlines-Announces-Enhanced-Cleaning-Procedures-and-New-Personal-Protective-Equipment-for-Customers-OPS-DIS-04/, https://hub.united.com/united-coronavirus-covid19-safety-update-2645397564.html#flight-attendants, https://www.cmaj.ca/content/cmaj/192/15/E410.full.pdf, https://www.who.int/ith/mode_of_travel/tcd_aircraft/en/, https://www.iata.org/contentassets/fe92ab7e0d864d3ab5c8e4fd632293e0/physical-distancing-onboard-covid-19.pdf, https://engineering.purdue.edu/~yanchen/, https://abcnews.go.com/US/democratic-lawmakers-call-federal-action-require-masks-planes/story?id=70423945, https://news.delta.com/delta-blocking-middle-seats-pausing-automatic-advance-upgrades-and-more-enable-more-space-safer, https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-05-05-01/, https://appropriations.house.gov/events/hearings/federal-aviation-administration-budget-request-for-fy2021, https://www.airlines.org/news/leading-u-s-airlines-begin-requiring-face-coverings-for-customer-facing-employees-and-passengers/, https://news.delta.com/facecoverings?src=facemasksnewshub1, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373291/, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2010.00676.x, https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa031349, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920301125?via%3Dihub, http://blog.jetblue.com/coronavirus/, http://news.emory.edu/stories/2018/03/airline_disease_transmission_study/, https://www.airlines.org/blog/covid-19-how-u-s-carriers-are-working-to-protect-travelers/, https://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3623.short, https://icahn.mssm.edu/profiles/rachel-vreeman",false,"Texas, Health Check, Coronavirus, Gary Kelly, "

We wondered whether the federal government is really planning to snoop on people's body mass index, which, in certain ranges, can be a predictor of costly, debilitating and even deadly diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. As we first related in a fact-check in October 2009, computerizing medical records has long been a goal of policymakers across the ideological spectrum. The idea is to shift from paper-based records to electronic ones, so that doctors can access information about patients more quickly and easily and make better clinical decisions as a result. Supporters hope that electronic medical records will reduce the frequency of medical errors, unnecessary diagnostic tests and inappropriate treatments. They also hope that, in the long term, streamlining record-keeping could bring down the rapidly escalating cost of health care. The effort did not begin with President Barack Obama. In 2004, President George W. Bush issued an executive order creating incentives for the adoption of information technology by 2014, to be spearheaded by a new federal official, the national coordinator for Health Information Technology. Under Obama, Congress passed his economic stimulus package in February 2009. The stimulus included several items designed to promote health information technology, including $19 billion over four years to fund electronic infrastructure improvements and the widespread adoption of electronic health records by providers, typically through higher Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements for doctors who use electronic medical records effectively. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology describes the Nationwide Health Information Network as a """"network of networks."""" All the experts we spoke to emphasized that it is not a single database residing at, say, a federal agency. It's more accurately viewed as a network to link many separate databases where records already exist, such as regional databases or medical offices, along with efforts to establish common technical standards so that these far-flung repositories of data can exchange information as needed. So will an intrusive government will have access to your private medical information? The short answer is: No. """"The records would be held by physicians and providers -- there is no such 'federal health record' on all Americans being compiled by the government,"""" said Deven McGraw, director of the health privacy project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a group that follows electronic privacy issues. The Department of Health and Human Services """"is not establishing a record for each person -- they are administering a program whereby physicians and hospitals can establish electronic medical records for their patients."""" In July 2010, HHS issued its first in a series of final regulations on how the incentive program for medical professionals will work, covering 2011 and 2012. Among other things, doctors will have to record body mass index as one of a number of statistics included in the new electronic medical record. (Click here to see a summary of the full list.) """"This information is going into the physician or hospital's medical record, where it is considered confidential and subject to ethical and legal protections against inappropriate use and disclosure,"""" McGraw said. """"It is not information going into a government record."""" So, doctors have to track body mass index on the new electronic forms and report adult weight data to the government in order to receive their incentive payments. Why isn't Buerkle right? Because providers will be reporting information on patients' vital statistics only in aggregate, not with any personal identification attached. So while the federal government will have a new, large data set on Americans' weight, it will not know who weighs how much. """"I question how the government could obtain information -- let alone current information -- on BMI or other health status of everyone even if there was a desire to do so,"""" said Marty Robins, an Illinois-based attorney and adjunct law professor at Northwestern and DePaul universities who has expressed concerns about how safe electronic records will be from hackers. When we showed Buerkle's letter to HHS, spokeswoman Jessica Santillo called the allegations """"."""" Meanwhile, Glenn Laffel, senior vice president for clinical affairs at Practice Fusion, a company that helps doctors conform to electronic medical records regulations, calls Buerkle's charge """"hogwash."""" """"The federal government has legitimate concerns about the obesity epidemic in this country because this condition increases Medicare and Medicaid expenditures,"""" Laffel said. """"But its efforts to deal with the crisis don’t include anything like the assertions being made"""" in Buerkle's letter. Pamela Snyder, Buerkle's campaign manager, said the campaign stands by the letter. For starters, Snyder said in an e-mail, the information in these files may be subject to unauthorized access or hacking, potentially making them accessible """"not simply a doctor and patient, but by health plans, hospitals, other doctors, pharmacies, insurance payors and government regulators."""" In the campaign's view, she said, """"there are extremely serious privacy issues involved."""" On that point, few would disagree. Indeed, this question has prompted much interest -- and legislative and regulatory activity. But while the experts we spoke to were among those expressing concerns about privacy and security, they didn't interpret Buerkle's letter as focusing on privacy concerns. We don't either. While the letter does mention in passing that the system is """"susceptible to abuse,"""" Buerkle's letter discusses in much greater detail, and much more forceful language, about a federal bureaucracy that is intruding too deeply into Americans' private lives. Snyder also said the campaign """"never stated that the (electronic health records) would be compiled in a government file -- only that the government was moving to make sure those files were compiled and contained certain information."""" We think that this more restrained interpretation -- which is pretty close to accurate -- is undermined by Buerkle's own words, including such phrases as """"big government,"""" """"unacceptable intrusion by government into the private lives of Americans"""" and """"expansion of federal bureaucracies."""" We believe a reasonable person would infer that when Buerkle says that """"the Obama Health and Human Services Department is planning to compile a federal health record on all U.S. citizens by 2014,"""" including """"each individual’s Body Mass Index,"""" she means that federal officials will have access to each person's BMI. That is not at all what is envisioned.""","https://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=1147&parentname=CommunityPage&parentid=3&mode=2&in_hi_userid=10741&cached=true, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marty-robins/electronic-medical-record_b_667990.html, https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/22/senior-citizens-league/seniors-group-warns-about-risks-electronic-health-/, http://healthpolicyandreform.nejm.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/20100713_blumenthal_t1.jpeg, https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2009/dec/18/politifact-lie-year-death-panels/, http://healthpolicyandreform.nejm.org/?p=3732&query=home%5C, http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2005/janqtr/pdf/3CFR13335.pdf, https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2009/aug/25/rationing-scare-words-health-care-debate/, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3257/is_6_58/ai_n6081759/, http://www.buerkleforcongress.com/index.php/a-letter-from-ann-marie-buerkle/",false,"National, Health Care, Privacy Issues, Ann Marie Buerkle, "

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared hundreds of times. (Screenshot from Facebook) A good rule of thumb is that if an online medical cure sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Such is the case with this Facebook post, which has been debunked by several other media outlets. While health experts recommend drinking water regularly to stay healthy, there is no evidence that sipping some every 15 minutes can help prevent coronavirus infection. The primary way the virus spreads is through close contact with infected people and respiratory droplets, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When someone with the coronavirus coughs or sneezes, their germs land on surfaces around them. The virus then infects people who touch those surfaces and then their eyes, nose and mouth. So to prevent contracting the coronavirus, the CDC advises people to avoid touching their face as much as possible. Other ways to prevent infection include washing your hands with soap and water, covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and regularly sanitizing the surfaces in your home or at your workstation. As of now, there is no specific treatment for the virus.

23107,"""Michael Bennet cast the deciding vote"""" for the stimulus and the health care bill.""","October 26, 2010","NRSC attacks Michael Bennet for casting 'the deciding vote' for stimulus, health care",Louis Jacobson,"""If you're seeking to tie your opponent to two controversial bills, what better way to do it than to say he cast the deciding vote to pass them? That's exactly what the National Republican Senatorial Committee is doing in the Colorado Senate race between incumbent Democrat Michael Bennet and GOP nominee Ken Buck. On Oct. 6, 2010, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm ran an ad attacking Bennet's role in helping pass two Democratic-sponsored bills, the economic stimulus and the health care overhaul. """"One vote makes a difference,"""" the narrator says. """"Michael Bennet cast the deciding vote for Obama's stimulus that wasted billions, added to the debt and didn't create the jobs they promised. Bennet cast the deciding vote to allow passage of the trillion-dollar health care bill that slashed Medicare, hurting seniors. Bennet's vote was the key to billions in job-killing taxes, too. Michael Bennet: He's been their vote, not Colorado's."""" We won't tackle the ad's description of the substance of the two bills. (We've addressed some of those points in the past.) Instead, we'll look at whether it's fair to call Bennet the deciding vote on those bills. First, some background on how the bills passed. Both measures had long and roundabout legislative paths to President Barack Obama's desk, but we'll stick to the two votes the ad specifically references on screen. The stimulus vote cited in the ad was taken Feb. 13, 2009. It was to approve the conference report of the bill -- that is, the version that both chambers must pass with identical language. Once both chambers pass identical versions, the bill goes to the president to be signed. For the stimulus, the final vote was 60-38, with exactly the number of votes needed to meet the three-fifths supermajority required of most major actions in the Senate. Meanwhile, the health care vote mentioned in the ad was taken Dec. 23, 2009. The vote was to invoke cloture -- that is, to cut off debate so that consideration of the bill could proceed. Invoking cloture requires 60 votes, and in this case the Democrats once again got exactly the 60 votes required. The idea that the Democrats couldn't spare even a single vote is the crux of the NRSC's argument. """"Absolutely Michael Bennet was the deciding vote,"""" NRSC spokesman Brian Walsh told PolitiFact. """"Had he not done so, they wouldn’t have passed the health care bill, regardless of whether he was first, middle or last to cast his vote. End of story."""" But is it? What about the argument that Bennet was merely one of 60 deciding votes. Couldn't the same charge be leveled at every member of the Senate who voted as Bennet did? We ran the issue by a variety of congressional scholars, and most agreed that it was a stretch for the NRSC to label Bennet's vote """"the deciding vote."""" """"That statement is misleading and a distortion of fact,"""" said James Thurber, a political scientist at American University. Several experts we spoke to pointed to historical examples in which lawmakers waited until the last moment to help push the bill over the top. Norman Ornstein, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, pointed to President Bill Clinton's attempt to pass the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 -- a bill that critics loathe for raising taxes but which supporters praise for eventually producing surpluses in the latter part of the decade. Lacking any Republican support in Congress, the measure faced nail-biter votes in both chambers, with then-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, D-Pa., and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., attracting wide attention for remaining undecided until shortly before the votes and then ultimately voting yes. In Margolies-Mezvinsky's case, her loss the following year was universally blamed on that vote. Then there was the 1985 vote on President Ronald Reagan's budget by then-Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif. Wilson was wheeled onto the Senate floor wearing blue pajamas following surgery for a ruptured appendix. """"That could be called a deciding vote,"""" said Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution senior fellow emeritus. Indeed, there's a long and storied history of senators holding back on supporting a bill until certain demands are met, said Donald Ritchie, the historian of the Senate. This approach """"takes some nerve, because the undecided vote may come under fire from both sides, but the rewards can sometimes be significant,"""" Ritchie said. So, did Bennet's approval of the stimulus and the health care bill follow the same pattern? The short answer is no. On the stimulus, Bennet spoke favorably of the bill at least as early as Jan. 31, 2009 -- two weeks before he cast the vote cited in the ad -- when the Rocky Mountain News paraphrased him saying he """"likes the overall direction of the legislation."""" He was part of a bipartisan group of 20 Senators trying to shrink the size of the stimulus, which suggests that he was sufficiently supportive of the bill that he was willing to work behind closed doors to see it succeed. His approach does not seem like that of a reluctant holdout. On health care, Bennet actually took to the Senate floor to forcefully criticize deals struck by party leaders on behalf of holdout Democratic Senators, hoping to persuade them to vote for the health care bill. """"Columnists opposed to reform have criticized me for saying that I am willing to lose my seat to enact meaningful health care reform,"""" he said on Dec. 21, 2010, two days before the vote. """"Now, I am being asked why I didn't negotiate a special deal with leadership. In fact, there was a report this morning criticizing me because the National Republican Senatorial Committee was rejoicing that I did not ask for special favors. Only in Washington would someone be attacked for not negotiating a backroom deal. Just because others choose to engage in the same tired Washington rituals, doesn't mean that I have to."""" Bennet continued, """"So I have a message for the columnists, the political professionals, and those back home. I am not happy about the backroom deals. I am not happy that the public option was held hostage by people in our own party. I do not support rewarding delay with special deals. I will let others justify their vote and their tactics."""" Indeed, as the health care debate came to a climax in the Senate, a stronger case can be made that any of several other senators deserve the title of the """"deciding vote."""" In a Dec. 24, 2009, account tracing the health bill's Senate endgame, Noam N. Levey and Janet Hook of the Los Angeles Times cited Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., as a late holdout, due to his opposition to a proposal for a """"Medicare buy-in."""" That policy would have allowed certain non-senior citizens to voluntarily join the federal health care plan for the elderly. According to the article, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., """"knew that he had to keep Lieberman in the tent. And the next night, when Democrats gathered for a special caucus meeting, Reid did not call out the Connecticut senator, focusing instead on the need to unite and move forward. Without the Medicare buy-in, Lieberman would be the 59th vote."""" At the meeting, Reid turned to Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., """"who had a long list of demands, including more restrictions on funding abortions and full federal funding to expand Nebraska's Medicaid program. ... Reid was closing in on a deal."""" Suddenly, another roadblock appeared: Republican opponents of the bill threatened to filibuster -- that is, indefinitely block consideration of -- an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the health care measure. To get around that, Reid had to convince Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. -- an opponent of the defense bill for substantive reasons -- not to join the Republican blockade. """"Reid was unwilling to challenge Feingold on a vote of conscience,"""" the Los Angeles Times article reported. """"And when Democrats gathered for yet another special caucus meeting ... Reid was ready to concede defeat. But as dejected senators began to leave, Feingold arose: He would put aside his convictions on the war, he said, and vote with his party. 'I don't think there was a dry eye in the caucus room,' said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md."""" And there was at least one more potential deciding vote -- the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. It wasn't a question of whether Byrd would support the bill but rather a question of whether he'd be physically able to reach the chamber to vote. Byrd had spent six weeks in the hospital earlier in 2009 with a staph infection. On the day of the vote, Byrd """"was pushed onto the Senate floor in his plaid wheelchair,"""" bundled in a coat, scarf and hat, according to an account in the New York Times. Lieberman, Nelson, Feingold, Byrd -- any of them could easily have been described as the deciding vote on the health care bill. So could any of the other 56 senators voting in favor. The NRSC ad """"is true, but not very informative, since there were 60 deciding votes,"""" concludes David W. Rohde, a Duke University political scientist. The NRSC ad would have been quite justified in describing Bennet's vote for either bill as """"crucial"""" or """"necessary"""" to passage of either bill, or even as """"a deciding vote."""" But we can't find any rationale for singling Bennet out as """"the deciding vote"""" in either case. He made his support for the stimulus bill known early on and was not a holdout on either bill. To ignore that and the fact that other senators played a key role in completing the needed vote total for the health care bill, leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression from message conveyed by the ad.""","http://coloradoindependent.com/20925/bennet-udall-part-of-group-weighing-cuts-to-senate-stimulus-package, http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00395, http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00064, https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/us/politics/24byrd.html, http://bennet.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/?id=08aedb65-5fda-47e6-b609-6da9e49be593, http://www.nrsc.org/nrsc-launches-new-ad-in-colorado-senate-race-one-vote, http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/jan/31/bennets-first-votes-scrutinized-by-gop/",false,"National, Health Care, History, Message Machine 2010, Stimulus, National Republican Senatorial Committee, "

Murphy, like most congressional Democrats, has opposed Republican-led efforts to conditionally fund anti-Zika efforts at less than what Obama has requested. But he has offered other solutions and voted against his party for two bills that would have allowed unspecified amounts of money to be repurposed for Zika programs. So the campaign was wrong to say he voted against """"every"""" measure.""",Joshua Gillin,"""While the Senate bickers over Zika funding, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s campaign says Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy has been playing partisan politics over the issue in the House. The same day the Senate failed to approve emergency public health funding to deal with Zika for the third time in three months, Rubio spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas said Murphy has been an obstructionist. """"Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika,"""" she said on Sept. 7, 2016. (By """"only,"""" she meant the only general election Senate candidate, comparing Murphy to Rubio.) That doesn’t sound like the position a Florida congressman facing a Zika outbreak would take in an election year, so we checked the record. We should note Rubio has supported high-level funding for Zika efforts, even co-sponsoring a bill with Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Perez-Cubas was speaking for Rubio, so we are putting Rubio on the Truth-O-Meter. It turns out Murphy has opposed plenty of Republican-backed funding proposals, but """"every"""" is putting it too strong. He still has voted for some measures. Funding malaise President Barack Obama first asked Congress for $1.89 billion in funding in February 2016 to deal with a potential outbreak of Zika. The virus has been linked to cases of infant microcephaly, or babies born with abnormally small heads. There is no treatment or vaccine for the disease, so focus has been on prevention. There are at least 771 cases of Zika in Florida, including several local transmissions in the Miami area. But that count may not always be the most accurate. Murphy has been involved with other Zika-related bills, including acting as a cosponsor for a Democrat-favored measure (HR 5044) that provided the full amount Obama requested. Those bills have not left committees in the House. A deeply partisan Congress, meanwhile, has fought all year over finding the money for mosquito control, vaccine development, diagnosing the disease, public education campaigns and more. There have been several measures introduced to deal with the disease, but the main focus this summer has been on some legislative wrangling over appropriations bills. House Republicans on May 18 passed a measure (HR 5243) that would have provided $622 million for Zika. With Obama threatening to veto the measure, Murphy voted no on that one with other Democrats. It was not taken up in the Senate. The next day, Murphy voted yes for a bill (HR 4974) that would have allowed the White House to repurpose leftover funding to deal with the 2014 Ebola outbreak and use it for Zika. Rubio’s campaign said this bill didn’t count, because there was no specified dollar amount, and didn’t guarantee the money would be used for Zika, only that it could. But that’s splitting hairs, because HR 4974 still would have provided at least one option to fund Zika-related programs. Now it’s time for a civics lesson, because what the House did next wasn’t covered on Schoolhouse Rock. The House then passed another bill (HR 2557) that was originally about funding for transportation and other agencies. Instead, the bill became a vehicle for Zika funding using language from HR 5243, the Republican measure. The House wanted $622 million for Zika, but cut that money from other programs in order to stay budget-neutral, a process known as recission. The House also added provisions restricting contraception services that Democrats opposed. The Senate wanted $1.1 billion in new funding. The bill went to conference in June to iron out differences. The House agreed to $1.1 billion in funding, as long as about $700 million was found through cutting other areas. Murphy voted against final passage of HR 2577, and against adopting the conference report instituting the changes. The Senate is currently battling over the bill. Senate Democrats have so far blocked a vote three times in three months, wanting a """"clean"""" bill with no contraception provisions and the full $1.89 billion originally requested. That’s not the end of the line, however. On June 16, Murphy voted for HR 5293, a bill that would allow the administration to shift money in the Defense Department to help with Zika efforts through that agency. Again, there was no set dollar amount or guarantee that’s how the money would be used, but it was another option in the Zika toolbox. It passed the House but is stuck in the Senate. """"Murphy did vote in favor of two efforts to transfer funds in support of Zika efforts and opposed the major effort in hopes of gaining more funding than the Republicans offered,"""" said Steven Smith, a Washington University in St. Louis political science professor. Our ruling Rubio, through a spokeswoman, said, """"Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika.""""

26106,"“If we stopped testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any.”","June 17, 2020",The swelling pandemic requires a more aggressive response than the White House has so far outlined. Halting testing wouldn’t eliminate COVID-19 cases. It would conceal them and could fuel an even greater crisis.,Shefali Luthra,"""President Donald Trump sought to downplay the numbers associated with COVID-19 in the United States — which have passed 2 million confirmed cases and are nearing 120,000 lives lost — by arguing that the soaring national count was simply the result of superior testing. """"If you don't test, you don't have any cases,"""" Trump said at a June 15 roundtable discussion at the White House. """"If we stopped testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any."""" It’s a talking point the administration is emphasizing. Vice President Mike Pence reiterated it during a phone call to Republican governors that evening, recommending they use the argument as a strategy to quiet public concern about surging case tallies in some states. It’s also a variation on a tweet the president sent earlier in the day. With that in mind, we wanted to dig deeper. We reached out to the White House for comment or clarification, but we never heard back. Independent researchers told us, though, that the president’s remarks are not only misleading — they’re also counterproductive in terms of thinking through what’s needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Essentially, the president is arguing that the United States is finding more cases of COVID-19 because we are testing more – and our increased testing makes it look like we have a worse epidemic than other countries do. """"We will show more — more cases when other countries have far more cases than we do; they just don’t talk about it,"""" he added. But that isn’t true. The numbers paint a stark picture. The United States has recorded 2.1 million cases of the novel virus so far, about a quarter of the global total and more than any other country. To Trump’s point, the country is testing more now than it did at the start of the outbreak — per capita, the U.S. is in the top 20% of countries when it comes to cumulative tests run. But this beefed up testing is still likely undercounting. The problem is that the U.S. outbreak is worse than that of many other countries – so we need to be testing a higher percentage of our population than do others. A way to understand this: the number of tests necessary to identify a positive case. If it’s easier to find a positive case, that suggests the virus has spread further and more testing is necessary to track the spread of COVID-19. For instance, statistics from the United States and the United Kingdom are fairly similar in terms of how many coronavirus tests are done daily per million people. But those tests yield far more positive cases in the United States. That suggests the outbreak here requires more per-capita testing than does the U.K.’s. """"We have a much bigger epidemic, so you have to test more proportionately,"""" said Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Put another way, a larger health crisis means — even after controlling for population size — the United States will have to test more people to find out where and how the virus has spread. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) And while the U.S. has ramped up its testing since March, many parts of the country still don’t have sufficient systems in place — from facilities to staff to medical supplies — for diagnosing COVID-19, researchers told us. And what about the president’s assertion that """"if we stopped testing right now, we’d have very few cases"""" or none at all? On its literal phrasing, it’s absurd, experts said. """"The implication that not testing makes the problem go away is completely false. It could not be more false,"""" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. That’s because testing doesn’t create instances of the virus — it is just a way of showing and tracking them. (The president made a similar point during the same White House roundtable event.) But even if you take it figuratively – the idea that our expanded testing resources have inflated our sense of the epidemic – it’s still misleading. """"We’re seeing a lot of cases because we’re testing? It just doesn’t ring true,"""" Kates said. """"The U.S. has made a lot of progress for sure. But that job is not finished."""" The president’s claim is part of a larger re-election strategy, argued Robert Blendon, a health care pollster at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The idea is to suggest that the health crisis is mostly exaggerated – and that things are getting better, and Americans should feel comfortable going back to work. """"If the economy takes off, the president has a chance of re-election,"""" Blendon said. """"If it contracts as a result of expansion of cases, and the only way we know how to respond is restriction of economic activity, he’s gone."""" But the problem, Blendon added, is that COVID-19 counts are still climbing in multiple states. And people are still dying of the virus. That gets at another point: Diagnostic testing isn’t the only data source to reveal the pandemic’s existence. Let’s not forget about hospitalization rates and death counts. The number of deaths continues to rise, and hospitalizations are higher than they would be in the virus’s absence. Trump argued that the nation’s high count of COVID-19 cases is simply a result of our expanded testing capacity. His point is entirely incorrect. The most relevant data suggests that the U.S. isn’t testing enough to match the severity of the pandemic. Even with our higher testing ratio, we’re probably still undercounting compared to other countries. Testing doesn’t create the virus. Even without diagnostics, COVID-19 would still pose a problem. We just would know less about it. And in fact, eliminating testing may alter the public’s perception of the pandemic, but it wouldn’t conceal it. If anything, it would likely worsen the crisis, since the public health system wouldn’t know how to accurately track and prevent the spread of the virus. The claim has no merit and seriously misrepresents the severity of the public health crisis.""","https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/world/coronavirus-usa-world.html?campaign_id=60&emc=edit_na_20200615&instance_id=0&nl=breaking-news&ref=headline&regi_id=57051614&segment_id=30993&user_id=d338c89be23e83b2fc4636737eaa99d9, https://www.c-span.org/video/?473086-1/president-trump-speaks-reporters-white-house",false,"Health Check, Coronavirus, Donald Trump, "

Zero Hedge, a blog with a track record of publishing  information, said in a Jan. 26 story that the coronavirus is part of a Chinese plot to develop a bioweapon. The article was republished from a website called Great Game India. """"Last year a mysterious shipment was caught smuggling Coronavirus from Canada. It was traced to Chinese agents working at a Canadian lab,"""" the story reads. """"Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to Chinese Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak."""" The story weaves together unrelated facts to construct a conspiracy theory. Officials are still trying to determine the exact cause of the outbreak, but there’s no evidence of it being created for use as a bioweapon. (Screenshot from Zero Hedge) The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The virus, which originated in the central China city of Wuhan, has infected more than 4,000 people worldwide, and China has restricted travel within the country amid a rising death toll. Great Game India claims that the current coronavirus outbreak can be traced to Chinese agents who infiltrated a Canadian lab to steal virus samples. But there’s no evidence for that. The story focuses on the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. In 2013, researchers there were investigating a new cluster of coronavirus infections that appeared to have originated in Saudi Arabia. Great Game India implies that disease is the same one that’s currently affecting China. But the lab was examining the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. (There are seven kinds of coronaviruses that can infect humans.) One of the scientists mentioned in the Great Game India story, Xiangguo Qiu, is under investigation for a possible """"policy breach"""" after she was invited to the Wuhan lab twice a year for two years. Qiu, her husband and her students from China were removed from the lab in July 2019. There are questions about what information Qiu shared with Chinese officials while visiting Wuhan, and the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory has sent viruses to China in the past for research. But there is no evidence to support the claim that Qiu stole coronavirus samples and gave them to the Wuhan lab to create biological weapons. The assertion that the origin of the coronavirus outbreak is a Chinese lab near Wuhan also lacks evidence. The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is a maximum-security biolab that deals with some of the world’s most dangerous pathogens, such as Ebola and the SARS coronavirus. Some experts have linked the lab to China’s biological warfare program. The country denies having such a program, but the State Department has raised concerns about China’s potential noncompliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, which bans the production of such weapons. """"Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus,"""" the Great Game India story reads. As of now, however, the lab’s proximity to the seafood market is a coincidence, as there is no evidence that the lab is the source of the coronavirus outbreak. In its most recent situation summary, the CDC said that both it and Chinese authorities had isolated the genome of the Wuhan coronavirus. Their findings suggest """"a likely single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus."""" Early reports suggested that the disease appeared to have originated at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, and it spread from there to several Asian countries, Australia, France, Canada and the United States.

19455,"""CNSNews Says """"under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not.""","September 7, 2012","In Oregon, do 15-year-olds have complete control over sterilization?",Ian K. Kullgren,"""In early August, CNSNews.com published an article with the headline """"Obamacare Mandate: Sterilize 15-Year-Old Girls for Free –Without Parental Consent."""" """"Thanks to an Obamacare regulation that took effect on Aug. 1,"""" read the article, """"health care plans in Oregon will now be required to provide free sterilizations to 15-year-old girls even if the parents of those girls do not consent to the procedure."""" The article went on to note that """"Under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not."""" The story got picked up by several websites, quickly making its way around the web – and into our mailbox. Of course, we were curious, too, so we got to checking. Before we get to our findings, here's a little context about CNSNews.com for those – like us – who had not heard of it. CNSNews.com, based in a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C., says its goal is to """"provide an alternative news source that would cover stories that are subject to the bias of omission and report on other news subject to bias by commission."""" It is not affiliated with Catholic News Service, which sometimes uses the same CNS abbreviation. First, we checked the larger context of the article to see if """"Obamacare"""" (the Affordable Care Act) requires health insurers to cover sterilization. We made several calls before we finally came up with a solid source that confirmed the new law requires providers to cover sterilization without cost to the patient. According to the U.S. Health Resource and Services Administration, services that fall under """"women's preventive health care"""" are supposed to be covered for free, including mammograms, screenings for cervical cancer, prenatal care, contraception, sexually transmitted infection counseling and – yes –""""sterilization procedures."""" As for the more salient detail – the age of consent in Oregon – we found a piece of Oregon law, which states that """"a minor 15 years of age or older may give consent, without the consent of a parent or guardian of the minor, to: Hospital care, medical or surgical diagnosis or treatment by a physician licensed by the Oregon Medical Board …""""  Essentially, CNSNews.com linked those two pieces of information – the new requirements that insurance companies cover sterilization for free and the fact that Oregon's age of consent for health care is 15 years old. The idea that 15-year-old girls would be lining up for free on-demand sterilizations struck our readers either as scary - """"Is this true?"""" - or ridiculous - """"This can't be true."""" We kept reporting. We checked whether sterilization had always been covered by the Oregon Health Plan, the state-run health care insurance program that covers 600,000 people a month. We called Oregon Health Authority spokeswoman Alissa Robbins, who confirmed that it has been included since the plan's inception in 1994. We also asked how many 15-, 16 – and 17-year-olds had received sterilizations under the plan. Robbins checked records for the last 10 years and found no sterilization procedure for a 15-year-old or a 16-year-old. As for 17-year-olds, she said, at most one such procedure is performed each year, though some years none is performed. She couldn't tell us the reason, she said, because it was """"protected health information."""" However, it seems clear to us that the procedure for young women in that age bracket is exceedingly rare. Robbins also pointed us to ORS 436, which lays out the warnings and consent procedures for anyone seeking sterilization, including minors. If a physician feels a minor is not capable of making an informed consent to be sterilized, her only recourse is to go to court and ask a judge to order that she is. We also checked with OHSU Hospital to see what the process would be for a minor looking to be sterilized there. Spokeswoman Tamara Hargens-Bradley got back to us with a lengthy email. For any patient under 30, she said, the hospital offers counseling about """"long-acting reversible contraceptives"""" and """"the risk of regret"""" in young women who are sterilized. The """"most likely scenario in which a teenager would request sterilization,"""" she wrote, """"is if she has a medical condition so severe that pregnancy would be life-threatening."""" If sterilization is not needed medically and a teen insists, Hargens-Bradley said the OHSU ethics committee would get involved. """"(T)hat would be very unusual and cause concern about whether the patient is capable of providing fully informed consent."""" She ended on this note: """"The health care reform offering contraception for free does not REQUIRE a physician to provide care they do not feel is safe for the patient. It requires that insurance plans cover all contraceptives available."""" After some vacation phone tag, we were able to talk to Michael Chapman, the CNSNews.com managing editor who had worked closely with the story's author, an intern who is no longer there. """"Our story is factual,"""" Chapman said. """"Out story reports what the law is in Oregon and it reports what the federal regulation is."""" Chapman said the article was stymied in part by little response from the Oregon Health Authority. """"It's great they're willing to say more now that the story has come out. """"Nearly all health insurers must provide sterilization ... that's a fact."""" In a subsequent email, Chapman pointed out language on the Oregon Health Authority's consent to sterilization form that reads """"I was told that the decision to be sterilized is completely up to me."""" The form is the last step in many checks and balances that is only signed after the patient finds a physician willing to perform the procedure. Now let's pull this together. Our reporting found that it's true that the health care act requires sterilizations to be free. It's also true that 15-year-olds can consent to health care without parental consent. But CNSNews.com goes even further by alleging that """"under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not."""" The statement would be accurate if it said health care plans in Oregon are required to pay for sterilizations for 15-year-old-girls. But instead, the statement confuses the insurers with providers – i.e. physicians – stating that 15-year-olds have """"complete control."""" That's not true. What a 15-year-old girl may want and what a medical provider is willing to do, at least in this case, are two very different things. Health care providers are under no obligation to provide sterilization on demand. In fact, free sterilization is not available on demand for 15-year-olds in Oregon. A 15-year-old must first convince a doctor that the procedure is medically necessary. While sometimes it is -- to treat cancer, for instance --a decade of records from the Oregon Health Plan and the explanation of procedures at OHSU show sterilization of 15-year-olds is incredibly rare. In Oregon, 15-year-old girls do not have """"complete control"""" over whether to be sterilized.

17451,"""Over half of the young people"""" in medical, dental and law schools are women.""","January 28, 2014","Paul said more than half of the enrollees in medical, dentistry and law schools are female. While women are close to 50 percent of enrollees in all three fields, they’re not a majority in any of them. And in both law and medicine, the trendlines for female enrollment have actually fallen in recent years.",Steve Contorno,"""Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee’s attempt to speak on women’s issues at a meeting of the Republican National Committee last week drew as much attention, if not more, than the party’s official business. At the meeting, Huckabee accused Democrats of believing that women """"cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government."""" On CNN’s State of the Union, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a possible 2016 presidential hopeful, was asked to weigh in on Huckabee’s comments. He turned the question to female advancement in education and the workplace. """"I've seen the women in my family and how well they're doing,"""" Paul said. """"My niece is in Cornell Vet School, and 85 percent of the people in vet school right now are women. Over half of the young people in medical school and dental school are women. Law school, the same way. I think women are doing very well, and I'm proud of how well we've come and how far we've come, and I think that some of the victimology and all this other stuff is trumped up."""" Host Candy Crowley didn’t press Paul on his comment about women and advanced degrees, but we decided to weigh in. By the numbers Women are indeed seeking advanced degrees at rates that far outpace men — in fact, that has been the case for many years. In 1990, males made up 53 percent of 25- to 29-year-olds with an advanced degree (that is, a master’s degree or higher). By 2000, the percentages had flipped, with women holding 58 percent of post-bachelor’s degrees among the same demographic, according to the U.S. Census. The breakdown remained similar in 2009. Paul’s problem was that he happened to choose specific fields — medicine, dentistry and law — where the statistics tell a different story. Let’s start with medicine. In 2013, 83,472 individuals were enrolled in medical schools across the United States, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. About 38,950 were women, or 46.7 percent. That’s close to half, but not quite. And the percentage of women in med school actually dropped over the past decade. In 2004, women made up 48.2 percent of the 70,816 med school enrollees. Now let’s move on to dental school. As it turns out, dentistry numbers are pretty similar to medical colleges. According to an American Dental Association education survey, there were 11,613 men in dental schools in 2010-11, and 10,240 women, or about 46.9 percent of enrollees. Unlike what happened in med school, the gender gap has shrunk in dental school over the past 10 years. In 2001-02, the dental school population was 40 percent female and 60 percent male. Finally, we turn to the law. In law school, men make up the majority, as well, and at rates similar to medicine and dentistry. According to the American Bar Association, there were 146,288 people enrolled in a juris doctorate program in 2011-12 and 68,262, or 46.7 percent, were women. Participation rates among women in law schools are far higher than they were in 1950, when they made up just 3 percent of enrollees. By 1980, females made up 35 percent of all law school campuses. But as was the case with medical school, the share of women in law school has actually declined somewhat in recent years. In 1992-93, women were a slight majority of law school students, at 50.4 percent of enrollees. From 2002 to 2004, they were close at 49.0 percent. Since 2006, they have hovered around 47 percent. So Paul’s claim is 0-for-3. We reached out to Paul’s office and they pointed us to an American Enterprise Institute study. The research backed up the overall trend in higher education we already pointed out — women are earning more advanced degrees than men — but it didn’t weigh on the specific fields Paul singled out. We checked out one more possibility: Were women a minority of enrollees, but a majority of those who ultimately earned degrees, because more men were washing out before graduation? We found that’s not the case either. In 2011-12, more men than women finished their medical, dental and law school programs, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. For the record, there are three fields that require specific advanced degrees where women do outnumber men. Of the degrees earned in optometry and pharmacy in 2012, two-thirds went to women, and about 78 percent of veterinary degrees went to females. In the others — dentistry, medicine, osteopathic medicine, podiatry, chiropractic, law and theology — men were the majority.

""""This is an incredibly contagious disease,"""" Paul said. """"People in full gloves and gowns are getting it. So really they need to be honest — this is a very transmissible disease."""" Paul added: """"They’re still learning about this. We’re all still learning about this. But this is not something that is hard to catch, this is something that appears to be very easy to catch."""" Is the Ebola virus """"incredibly contagious,"""" """"very transmissible"""" and """"easy to catch""""? We decided to check it out. Paul’s office said his comments implied that he was talking about how easy it is to get the virus from contact with an infected individual. In a lengthy response to PolitiFact, spokesman Brian Darling said that """"exposure to even a small amount of virus can cause infection."""" The 2014 outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa is the largest in history, according to the World Health Organization. It’s also the first time the virus has made its way to the United States; health officials confirmed the fourth U.S. case Thursday in a doctor returning to New York from treating Ebola patients in West Africa. So far, though, only two individuals — both Texas health care workers that treated an African man who later died from the disease — have contracted the virus on U.S. soil. This despite the fact that infected individuals have come into contact with dozens, if not hundreds, of people while they purportedly had the disease, including close family members. That seems to dispel, at least anecdotally, the idea that the disease is """"incredibly contagious"""" and """"easy to catch,"""" even from an infected person. But let’s get into the nitty gritty. How does Ebola spread? Ebola is not an airborne infection. For example, it is rare — if it’s even possible at all — that the disease would spread through coughing or sneezing (which are not even symptoms of Ebola, as our colleagues at PunditFact recently noted). According to the World Health Organization, Ebola spreads through """"human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people."""" This means that the most common way Ebola is spread is direct contact with vomit, blood or fecal matter of an infected patient. Individuals who have such contact are at high risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says """"being within approximately 3 feet of an (Ebola) patient or within the patient’s room or care area for a prolonged period of time,"""" is also potential cause for concern. But the organization noted the risk is low. There is also potential risk of transmission through contaminated surfaces and objects, however the World Health Organization notes the danger is, again, low, and most studies from previous Ebola outbreaks show that """"all cases were infected by direct close contact with symptomatic patients."""" Finally, experts note that individuals are not infectious — meaning they cannot spread the virus — until they are showing symptoms, which takes between 2 and 21 days. Symptoms start with a fever, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. So to be at a high risk of contracting Ebola, you need to come into contact with the blood, feces or vomit of someone who is showing symptoms. The number of people who find themselves in this situation are relatively small. There is potential for it to spread other ways — such as being in close range with someone who has the disease or touching an object contaminated by an infected person — but the risk is low, because """"as an enveloped virus, it has a low tendency to stay viable outside the body,"""" said Thomas Fekete, a professor of infectious diseases at the Temple University School of Medicine. """"And because it is not aerosolized it isn't especially easy to catch through the respiratory tract."""" How contagious is it? The CDC defines contagious as """"a very communicable disease capable of spreading rapidly from one person to another by contact or close proximity."""" In Africa, the disease has claimed so many victims because of poor health systems that lack supplies and safeguards and because of burial practices where people directly handle bodies without necessary protections. This is what caused such a large outbreak there. Burials are especially problematic because the near dead or recently dead have very high levels of the virus and are """"very infectious as a result,"""" said Christopher Whalen, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Georgia College of Public Health. But even in the worst outbreak Africa has experienced, health care officials have noted that the disease does not spread from one host to many others. The basic reproduction number, or R0, of a disease is calculated as the average number of secondary cases resulting from an infected individual entering an uninfected population. The higher the R0 is above 1, the greater the chances it has of spreading. The R0 of the Ebola virus in Africa during the recent outbreak has ranged from 1.20 to 2.02, depending on the country. That’s in line with historical data on the disease. How does that compare to other viruses? Well, HIV, which is only transmitted by sexual intercourse and blood transfers, has a R0 of 4. The measles has a R0 of 18. Meaning, while the disease has the potential to spread, """"minimum requirements for the containment of Ebola are far less severe than for the containment of more contagious diseases, such as measles,"""" according to the World Health Organization Ebola Response Team. Rachael Jones, a professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago School of Public Health, told PolitiFact: """"The epidemiological evidence suggests that Ebola is less infectious than many other viruses that commonly affect people, such as influenza."""" What if you come in contact with someone who has Ebola? Ebola is """"easy to catch"""" in the sense that you don't need prolonged contact with infected fluids to pick it up, Fekete said. However, not many people come in contact with these infected fluids. And, the evidence shows some people who do spend time around an infected patient don’t get the virus, either. """"It seems as though even a brief exposure to the virus can lead to a transmission event, as some patients describe one contact event with an ill patient,"""" Whalen said. """"But, on the other side, think of all of the family members of Ebola patients who were exposed in the household of a case, but didn’t develop the disease. We tend not to hear about them, yet they constitute an important part of our understanding the attack rate."""" But Paul’s spokesman, Darling, argued, """"The reason why doctors and nurses who come into contact with an infected individual wear 100 percent protection then have to go through a thorough disinfection process, is because it is ‘easy to catch’ from somebody who is showing symptoms."""" That’s not necessarily the case, according to health experts we spoke with. For one, health care workers are in close contact with infected individuals at their most infectious state and are handling bodily fluids known to carry higher concentrations of the virus. That puts them at greater risk than someone sitting next to a person who is infected, even if that person is showing symptoms. Further, unlike much more contagious diseases, Ebola causes death in 50 percent of patients. That sparks extra precaution. """"These recommendations arise from the seriousness of the infection, not from the infectivity of the pathogen,"""" Jones said. Given the high mortality rate from the disease, if it was """"incredibly contagious"""" and """"easy to catch,"""" the United States would likely have more deaths already. """"The joke that more Americans have been married to Kim Kardashian than have died of Ebola would not be true if it were so easy to catch,"""" Fekete said.

20069,There’s 400 more people working in health care today in New Hampshire than when we passed the budget.,"May 25, 2012","The health care industry was a bright spot during the recession, but job estimates show that it didn’t rebound from the state budget cuts the way O’Brien reported. The most recent state estimates show that jobs in the health care industry, combined with social assistance, have remained flat or even decreased – not gained – since April 2011, when the House initially passed the budget. And since the state budget took effect in June 2011, the industry has lost about 700 jobs. There is one measure that shows some growth, but it was only a snapshot and doesn’t cover the time period O’Brien was talking about. Based on the most authoritative numbers that include the most recent data.",Jake Berry,"""To paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of the demise of New Hampshire’s health care system have been greatly exaggerated – according to Speaker of the House William O’Brien, at least. Last year, the New Hampshire House of Representatives passed its $10.3 billion budget, which cut millions in funding for hospitals and health care providers. Funding to nursing homes was reduced by more than $30 million, according to administrators who decried the cuts, and hospitals lost $258 million over the two-year budget. But now, a year later, not only has the bleeding stopped, but the health care industry has even gained jobs since the budget passed, according to O’Brien, R-Mont Vernon. """"You know what’s interesting about those layoffs?"""" O’Brien asked rhetorically during a May 7 meeting with The Telegraph’s editorial board. """"There’s 400 more people working in health care today in New Hampshire than when we passed the budget."""" In recent years, health care has been one of few industries to grow despite the recession. But did New Hampshire’s health care industry not only rebound from the cuts, but grow to the tune of 400 jobs? We decided to crunch the numbers. When asked for the source of O’Brien’s figures, Shannon Shutts, a spokeswoman for the House of Representatives, pointed to the New Hampshire Employment Security agency. The office, which runs the state’s job centers and manages unemployment benefits, issues both quarterly and monthly employment reports estimating job growth in specific industries. According to the Employment Security office’s Current Employment Statistics report, 84,900 people worked in New Hampshire’s health care and social assistance fields in April 2012, the most recent numbers available. That number, based on employment surveys of selected hospitals, outpatient clinics, nursing homes and home care agencies, among others, is exactly the same as April 2011 and 100 fewer than March 2011. So that doesn’t show the gain O’Brien claimed. The House of Representatives passed its budget March 31, 2011, but it didn’t approve the final version of the budget for another three months, until June 22, 2011. According to the state jobs office, employment in the health care and social assistance sectors in June 2011 was 85,600. But it declined by 700 more by April 2012. In addition, at the time O’Brien made the claim May 7, the April 2012 unemployment numbers hadn’t been posted to the state’s website. If we calculate his claim using the March 2012 data that was available at the time, the numbers look even worse, since there were 400 fewer health care jobs in March than in April 2012. """"What you see in health care is really more of a slowdown,"""" said Annette Nielsen, an economist with the economic and labor market information bureau within the employment security office. """"A couple of years ago, you would see 2 or 3 percent strong growth over the year, and then even through the beginning of the recession, that was really the only bright spot there was,"""" she said. """"That is definitely slowing down."""" The state’s health care employment numbers, as classified by the economic security office, include both health care and social assistance jobs. Health care jobs include those working in hospitals, medical centers, outpatient clinics and nursing homes. Meanwhile, social assistance is defined as child care workers and home care providers for the elderly and those with disabilities, among others. But even without considering the social assistance fields, O’Brien’s numbers are still off. Hospitals across the state gained 100 jobs from April 2011 to April 2012, rising to 28,300 last month, according to the state report. But ambulatory care services, including chiropractors, optometrists, podiatrists, mental health professionals and diagnostic technicians, lost 1,300 jobs during that period. Compared to figures from June 2011, ambulatory care jobs were down 1,500 in April 2012 and hospital jobs suffered 200 losses, according to the state data. Admittedly, the state’s monthly job estimates are not perfect, acknowledged Nielson, of the employment security office. The figures are based on surveys collected from a sampling of employers, which are often returned late, and they don’t always reflect new and emerging businesses, she said. For a more accurate measure, economists often look to the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages report. The report, released every three months, is based on actual employment data reported to the employment security office for unemployment benefits claims. But because the data takes time to collect and analyze, reports are released only every three months. The most report reflects employment data through September 2011. According to that data, from April 2011 to September 2011, six months after the House passed the state budget and the longest period of available data, the number of people working in health care in the state grew by 402 jobs. Yet when using the June starting date, when the state budget took effect, there was a loss of 178 jobs during the next quarter of a year. Either way, this data is now eight months old, and much can – and likely has – changed in that time, Nielson said. """"You can’t compare the two,"""" she said. """"They’re two different time periods. … The trend is (that job growth is) really starting to flatten out."""" Our ruling The health care industry was a bright spot during the recession, but job estimates show that it didn’t rebound from the state budget cuts the way O’Brien reported.

The  accompanying story was from CNSnews.com, a site operated by the conservative Media Research Center. """"Over 214,000 Doctors Opt Out of Obamacare Exchanges,"""" read a headline on CNSnews.com. We found the source of the claim. It was coming from American Action Forum, a self-described """"center-right policy institute."""" The organization put out an analysis on Oct. 27 titled: """"Health Care Providers are Opting-Out of Obamacare Exchange Plans."""" How many? According to the post, """"as many as 214,524 American physicians will not be participating in any (Affordable Care Act) exchange products."""" It went on to list some reasons """"doctors are opting out of the exchange plans."""" That’s a lot of doctors. Have that many decided to turn away patients with insurance purchased on the marketplaces? Let’s take a look. Can doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges? The Affordable Care Act requires essentially everyone to have insurance. To make it easier for people to buy insurance, the government created federal and state insurance marketplaces, sometimes called exchanges. The biggest one is HealthCare.gov, but some states elected to operate their own as well. These marketplace policies are private plans sold by insurance companies. In some states, just one or two companies are providing plans; in others, it’s many. Consumers typically have dozens of choices ranging from bronze policies, which pay 60 percent of health costs on average, to platinum, which pay 90 percent of costs. (For comparison, a typical employer-based plan covers about 80 percent of costs.) Can doctors choose not to participate in the networks of policies purchased on exchanges? Sure. While some states require doctors to accept any plan for an insurance provider they do business with, in most cases insurance companies are constantly negotiating with physicians and hospitals to determine which policy networks they will participate in, experts and industry officials told us. Some doctors might decide they don’t want to be in the network of plans purchased on federal or state marketplaces. In other instances, insurance providers might choose not to include certain doctors or health groups in policies they created for the marketplaces. It’s a two-way street, and marketplace policies are just the latest twist to a contracting process that has always existed between doctors and insurance companies. 200,000 doctors? We asked American Action Forum to explain their analysis to us. The organization based its findings on an April survey from the Medical Group Management Association, a trade organization for physician groups. """"The survey found that 23.5 percent of doctors said they would not participate in (Affordable Care Act) exchange plans,"""" said Marisol Garibay, spokeswoman for American Action Forum. That percentage was multiplied by the total number of professional active physicians, which Kaiser Family Foundation estimates is 893,851. That equals 210,054 doctors, close to the American Action Forum number. Garibay called it an """"upper bound"""" estimate. But when we looked at the survey ourselves, we found this to be a pretty dubious figure. Here’s the rub, from the research: """"The survey includes responses from more than 700 medical groups in which more than 40,000 physicians practice nationwide."""" While there’s a lot of interesting information gleaned from this survey, the results cannot be extrapolated to represent all the doctors in the country. Why not? Because the Medical Group Management Association only represents doctors who are part of medical groups. This does not include physicians who run independent practices, for example, and there’s no reason that a poll of 700 medical groups is representative of all 900,000 physicians in the country. """"That’s a significant difference,"""" said Anders Gilberg, a senior vice president of government affairs for Medical Group Management Association. """"I wouldn’t generally suggest using it as a proxy for all physicians."""" Let’s put that aside for a second and dig further. The survey found that as of April, 76.5 percent of respondents were accepting health insurance sold on a state or federal marketplace. Of those not participating in marketplace policies, 42 percent said it was because insurance companies in their area didn’t ask them to participate in the networks of plans sold on marketplaces. Meaning, even if this limited survey could be extrapolated to represent all doctors, not all of them are """"opting out"""" of Obamacare. Many — almost half — weren’t asked to participate in ACA marketplace policies. Why weren’t they asked? One reason is that the insurance companies want to limit which doctors will serve their customers by creating narrow networks. Narrow networks are a way for insurance providers to keep costs lower for insurers. How? If you create a narrow network, it guarantees a doctor will get a bigger share of your patients, and a doctor would be willing to accept lower reimbursement rates in exchange for more business. Narrow networks are also more common on the exchanges because consumers can pick the plan with the doctors that fit their needs, said Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at University of Southern California. """"Employer plans tend to have a broad network because they’re trying to satisfy everyone (at the company),"""" Ginsburg said. """"On an exchange, you don’t have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer many, so you can have narrower plans."""" There are plenty of broad plans on the exchanges, they just tend to be more expensive. According to a May survey of individuals likely to use the marketplace, 54 percent said they would accept more limited networks to get a cheaper sticker price. As it is, 85 percent of plans bought on federal and state marketplaces were the less expensive bronze or silver plans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. To be sure, it appears some doctors want nothing to do with these cheaper marketplace plans or the customers who buy them. Among other things, doctors worry that many of the plans on the marketplace, particularly bronze and silver plans, have high deductibles. Some patients won’t be able to meet their obligations for cost-sharing, potentially forcing physicians to eat those costs or shake down customers. These are legitimate concerns, and there is reason to believe that some doctors are choosing not to contract with marketplace insurance plans. But there is no evidence to suggest the number is anywhere near 214,000. Our ruling A chain email claimed that more than 214,000 American doctors are """"opting-out of Obamacare exchange plans."""" That is based on a survey of a select group of doctors and even the makers of the survey said it can’t be extrapolated for the entire country.

Eugene Emery Jr.,"India banned the sale and import of e-cigarettes this month, warning of an “epidemic” of vaping among young people. The action has affected users nationwide and the plans of international companies including Juul Labs Inc and Philip Morris International, as well as triggering court challenges by local firms. Protesters convened on Saturday to call for vaping devices to be regulated rather than prohibited. But organizers Association of Vapers India said only about 400 people turned up across six cities, adding that some opponents of the ban feared being targeted by police. At one protest in the capital New Delhi, several people used vaping devices. Among them sat a child with a poster that read: “I don’t want my dad to be a smoker”. The government argues the ban is essential to protect people as vaping can lead to nicotine addiction and push users toward consuming tobacco. Vapers say the devices help them stay away from more harmful tobacco cigarettes. More than 900,000 people die each year due to tobacco-related illnesses in India, the government estimates. But the country has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China, making it a lucrative potential market for companies selling both tobacco and vaping products. An Indian health ministry official said the government was determined to stick by its ban, despite the protests and court challenges. “There is no question of a rollback or anything like that,” the official said. Two court challenges that could be pivotal for whether the ban can continue to be enforced are under way in the eastern city of Kolkata, including one by e-cigarette importer Plume Vapour. The company, in a court filing seen by Reuters, argues that the ban will allow cigarette companies to flourish while putting e-cigarette firms out of business.

But the dairy industry is making a much broader claim, saying the proposal targets milk and dairy products generally. That’s at best unclear. It’s likely unfounded, experts told us. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""",Jon Greenberg,"""The milk industry is upset with the World Health Organization, claiming the international group is pushing a set of marketing guidelines that put their products in a bad light. In a letter to President Barack Obama on May 9, 2016, the U.S. Dairy Export Council wrote that a WHO proposal """"portrays milk and dairy products as an obstacle to a healthy start in life."""" Does WHO think that milk and dairy products don’t do a baby’s body good? Proposed marketing guidelines At issue are proposed guidelines from the World Health Organization due for a vote at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, at the end of May. The document has been in the works for years and its stated purpose is to end """"the inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children, with the aim to promote, protect and support breastfeeding, prevent obesity,"""" and generally promote a healthy diet. Dairy exporters are not against breastfeeding, said Shawna Morris, vice president of trade policy for the U.S. Dairy Export Council. The problem, Morris said, is that the WHO proposal covers toddlers up to 3 years old. """"If we have images of a 1- or 2-year-old drinking milk, is that prohibited?"""" Morris said. """"It seems to us that it would be."""" Morris highlighted several troublesome clauses in the WHO document, including this one (emphasis ours): """"Products that function as breast-milk substitutes should not be promoted. A breast-milk substitute should be understood to include any milks (or products that could be used to replace milk, such as fortified soy milk), in either liquid or powdered form, that are specifically marketed for feeding infants and young children up to the age of 3 years (including follow-up formula and growing-up milks). As the trade groups see it, the proposal would go further. Yogurt, milk and cheese would fall under this definition, they say, when guidelines from the medical community say that most young children do just fine with these foods. Charles Taylor, a marketing professor at Villanova University’s School of Business, told us that the dairy industry has a point. He calls the document """"draconian."""" """"At best, the WHO guidelines are a one-sided argument in favor of their strongly held position that breastfeeding is healthier for children without giving the whole position,"""" Taylor said. """" At worst, they can be viewed as providing consumers with incomplete information on milk."""" How WHO responds Make no mistake, WHO doesn’t want to see breast-milk substitutes promoted. WHO contends, however, that the dairy industry is reading too much into the proposed marketing rules. The proposal says you can identify what products would be affected by how they’re pitched to the public. If they are """"specifically marketed for feeding infants and young children up to the age of 3 years,"""" then they are a breast-milk substitute. WHO officials says that excludes milk products such as yogurt, milk and cheese. WHO spokeswoman Olivia Lawe-Davies said that """"in no way does the guidance discourage the consumption of milk. In fact, WHO recommends milk consumption for older infants and young children who are not being breastfed."""" That jibes with current WHO guidelines for non-breastfed children age 2 and under. The guidelines state, """"Milk products are rich sources of calcium and several other nutrients. Diets that do not contain animal source foods (meat, poultry, fish or eggs, plus milk products) cannot meet all nutrient needs at this age."""" Davies said the new proposal simply adds marketing restrictions for products known as """"follow-up formula"""" and """"growing-up milks."""" Both are similar to infant formula, but the first one is aimed at infants from 6 months to 1 year, and the second is for toddlers up to 3 years. """"Milks marketed for infants and young children are breast-milk substitutes because they de facto displace the intake of breast milk,"""" Davies said. """"Milk that is marketed as a general family food is not covered by this recommendation since it is not marketed specifically for feeding of infants and young children."""" Reading between the lines Experts who have studied the language and are aware of both arguments say both the dairy industry and the World Health Organization have a point. Allyn Taylor has a special expertise in the legal ins and outs of these global health codes. Taylor, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law, was a senior legal adviser when the WHO crafted its rules on tobacco control. She has had no involvement with the latest guidelines. Taylor criticizes the current text as ambiguous, """"poorly written"""" and subject to interpretation. Taylor told us she hopes the wording will be debated at the upcoming World Health Assembly in Geneva. (Perhaps in a way to settle this dispute.) But even with that, she said to assert that the proposal casts milk as an obstacle goes too far. """"That is quite a pejorative claim,"""" Taylor said. """"You will not find any words in this document to that effect."""" Another law professor, Emily Parento at the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, Calif., agreed. The text of the proposal could be more tightly written, she said. But she didn’t see how that flaw gets you to the industry line that WHO is against milk products for toddlers. """"I can’t see the WHO not wanting little kids eating string cheese or having a cup of plain milk,"""" Parento said. """"That’s just not there."""" A key industry trend The world of powdered milk mixes has changed a lot since the current breast-milk formula marketing guidelines passed in 1981. Formula makers began targeting older infants and toddlers. A report from a New Zealand business group said the expansion produced a $55 billion a year market. In a nod to the impact of the 1981 WHO marketing guidelines, the report noted """"Infant formula is typically defined as """"birth to six months""""; the product is then renamed for a range of reasons (primarily to avoid regulation and restrictions on advertising)."""" Our ruling The U.S. Dairy Export Council said a WHO proposal """"wrongly portrays milk and dairy products as an obstacle to a healthy start in life."""" The proposal clearly is targeting some dairy products, specifically powdered formulations, as ones that work against the benefits that come from maintaining breastfeeding through a child’s early years. But the dairy industry is making a much broader claim, saying the proposal targets milk and dairy products generally. That’s at best unclear. It’s likely unfounded, experts told us.

16213,More people are losing their insurance (due to Obamacare) than are becoming newly insured.,"November 4, 2014","""Cain said that """"more people are losing their insurance (due to Obamacare) than are becoming newly insured."""" While it’s reasonable to ask questions about the limitations of the available data, there is wide consensus from five private-sector organizations that roughly 10 million more Americans are insured today than were before the law began operations in late 2013. That’s inconsistent with Cain’s claim.""",Louis Jacobson,"""Herman Cain’s longshot 2012 Republican presidential bid may be long over, but he’s continued to opine on national affairs. Take, for example, his recent blog post titled, """"Nine facts Democrats don't want you to hear before you vote tomorrow."""" The post, published Nov. 3, 2014, and forwarded to us by a reader, begins this way: """"As we all get ready to head to the polls tomorrow, Democrats want you focused on the Koch brothers (that evil, fang-toothed fictionalized version, not the real ones who are excellent and highly successful businessmen) and their ‘war on women’ crapola."""" The post goes on to offer nine bullet-point items that """"Democrats do not want to talk about,"""" including claims about the economy, home ownership, taxes, debt and foreign policy. On health care policy, Cain offers this: """"Obamacare is a failure! More people are losing their insurance than are becoming newly insured, and 51 percent of those enrolled in the exchanges say they will not re-up given the opportunity the next time around. Then there are the 29ers (people being limited to 29 hours a week because of Obamacare mandates) and the 49ers (not the San Francisco ones ... the businesses intentionally staying under 50 employees to avoid the coverage mandate). There are also thousands of doctors refusing patients with Obamacare coverage because they can’t cover their costs on the reimbursements, while thousands more doctors are retiring early."""" That’s a lot to chew on, but we were especially interested in checking Cain’s claim that """"more people are losing their insurance (due to Obamacare) than are becoming newly insured."""" (An inquiry to Cain’s staff was not returned.) We will start off with a big caveat: The data available on this question is imperfect. For starters, the most historically credible, long-term statistics for health coverage and uninsurance -- the annual figures published by the U.S. Census Bureau -- do not include the big surge in insurance signups that occurred during the first quarter of 2014, which was the deadline for obtaining insurance for 2014 under the Affordable Care Act. What remains is data compiled by the private sector. However, the figures for new signups are somewhat piecemeal, with a less certain historical track record than the Census data. And the figures for cancellations are even fuzzier. That said, we’ll look at the consensus of data compiled by private-sector organizations. These have been calculated on a net basis -- the number of newly covered Americans minus the number of Americans newly lacking coverage. For Cain to be right, this number would have to be negative -- more losses than gains. Is it? The polling company Gallup has been studying uninsurance rates every quarter in a reasonably real-time fashion. In its most recent study, covering the third quarter of 2014, Gallup found that 13.4 percent of Americans lacked health insurance. That’s down significantly from its 18 percent rate in the third quarter of 2013, before the health care exchanges began operations. (As a reminder, insurance-coverage gains from the health care law stem from several sources, including people who signed up for plans on the exchanges, people who were newly able to sign up for Medicaid coverage in the states that allowed it, and young adults under age 26 who were allowed to remain on their parents’ plan.) These Gallup numbers shows a decline in uninsured Americans of 4.6 percentage points since the law took full effect -- the opposite of the direction Cain suggests. All told, between October 2013 and June 2014, Gallup found that 10.3 million nonelderly adults gained health insurance coverage. It’s possible that this number has grown since the data cut off in June 2014. Gallup’s finding tracks with what other sources have found. The New England Journal of Medicine estimated that, through June, 10.3 million adults gained coverage. Also through June, the Commonwealth Fund estimated the number at 9.5 million. And over the same period, the Urban Institute offered an estimate of 8 million. An earlier study -- through March -- by the RAND Corp. estimated a net gain of 9.3 million American adults with health insurance. This is a high degree of similarity between five separate studies, pointing to a net increase of 9 million to 10 million through June. And there’s reason to believe that number could be higher. These estimates do not include children under 18, and it’s possible that additional Americans have gained insurance in the months since June. It’s certainly possible that some of the other elements of Obamacare, including employer mandates, will lead to further losses of coverage once they take effect. (The administration has delayed the start of employer contribution requirements.) And the administrative hassle of losing one’s former plan is undeniably a hassle, even if one ends up with a different plan later. But as of now, there isn’t any evidence to back up Cain’s claim that more people are actually losing coverage than gaining. Our ruling Cain said that """"more people are losing their insurance (due to Obamacare) than are becoming newly insured."""" While it’s reasonable to ask questions about the limitations of the available data, there is wide consensus from five private-sector organizations that roughly 10 million more Americans are insured today than were before the law began operations in late 2013.

So we weren't exactly surprised when we heard her suggest a link between Democratic presidents and the swine flu. Here's her comment, from an interview with Pajamas Media: """"I find it interesting that it was back in the 1970s that the swine flu broke out then under another Democrat president, Jimmy Carter. And I'm not blaming this on President Obama, I just think it's an interesting coincidence."""" Well, at least she's right about the decade. Yes, the last big swine flu scare occurred in the 1970s. But other than that, her statement is utterly false. The scare began in February 1976 when recruits at Fort Dix, N.J., came down with flu symptoms, and one died. This led to fears of a pandemic. The president in 1976 was Gerald Ford — a Republican. Ford, following the advice of public health officials, called for a nationwide vaccination program. In just 10 days, 40 million Americans were vaccinated. But three senior citizens died shortly after receiving their swine flu shots. A public outcry blamed the deaths on the immunizations even though there was no evidence. As a recent  article in Salon  notes, """"The government had long feared mass panic about swine flu — now they feared mass panic about the swine flu vaccinations."""" Political analyst Craig Crawford wrote this week that """"Gerald Ford's decision to inoculate every person in the country (including himself) resulted in a political debacle that contributed to a reputation for incompetence that scuttled his 1976 election bid."""" Swine flu also surfaced briefly in 1988, killing a woman in Wisconsin who had visited a swine exhibit at a county fair. The president at the time was Ronald Reagan — a Republican. So Bachmann is wrong about a Democrat being in charge during the 1976 outbreak and she fails to note the swine flu death in 1988. Hmmm. Two swine flu incidents during Republican administrations.

Rick Perry's administration proposed ending immunizations for 113,000 kids",Meghan Ashford-Grooms,"""Democratic state Rep. Mike Villarreal of San Antonio sees the potential for """"a public health disaster"""" in a document that lays out options for cutting the state health department's budget by 10 percent, according to a news release from his office. """"Perry administration proposes ending immunizations for 113,000 kids,"""" says the subject line of Villarreal's Sept. 7 statement. """"We want Texas kids in school learning, rather than sitting at home or the doctor's office suffering from preventable diseases. ... If we don't prevent the spread of diseases among these children, we put at risk all Texas kids who are too young to receive their immunizations yet."""" An end to immunizations for thousands of youngsters? We wondered if Villarreal's shot hit the spot. First, some background on the federal Vaccines for Children program, which Texas has participated in since 1994. According to the website of the Texas Department of State Health Services, the program provides vaccines to health care providers for eligible children, including those who lack health insurance and those enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid. In 2010, the federal government spent more than $380 million on immunizations for children in Texas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the state health services department, said 4.2 million Texas children qualified for the vaccinations under the federal program that year. To expand eligibility beyond the federal requirements, Texas pitches in some dollars so that any child who comes to a public health clinic can be immunized. The department is spending $7.1 million on the program in 2010-11 and expects to need $9.5 million for full funding in 2012-13. In May, Gov. Rick Perry and other state leaders, mindful of a looming revenue shortfall (lately pegged at $24 billion), asked state agencies to spell out possible 10 percent cuts in their budgets for 2012 and 2013. In August, the health services department laid out $238 million in possible reductions, with $7.7 million of that coming out of the state's spending on childhood immunizations. That proposal represents an 81 percent cut from what the agency expected to spend on the vaccination effort during 2012-13. The agency document, which Villarreal cites in his press release, describes the impact of the $7.7 million cut: """"At this level of reduction, the overall safety-net program will need to reduce the number of children being vaccinated with GR funds (estimated 112,661 children). A significant portion of these children could be affected."""" GR refers to general revenue funds. The document further says: """"This could end the public health clinic policy of turning no child away and instead will result in public clinics making referrals for those individuals that have health insurance to their medical homes for vaccines. If families are unable to go to their referral sites/medical homes, then the children may not be able to obtain vaccination services and could fall behind in the immunization schedule, ultimately lowering vaccine coverage levels and making our communities vulnerable to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases."""" A """"medical home"""" is one's usual health-care provider. While Villarreal's press release also says the Department of State Health Services """"estimates that half of the children could be immunized through other programs,"""" he concludes that the end result of the budget cut would be to eliminate immunizations for 113,000 children. At the agency, Williams disputed Villarreal's interpretation. She said 112,661 is the number of kids the agency estimated would receive vaccines purchased with general revenue in 2012-13. If the Legislature reduces the state contribution to the vaccine program by $7.7 million, she said, the agency estimates that half of the 112,661 children — about 56,000 — would not be able to receive immunizations at public health clinics. However, Williams said, that doesn't mean those kids would necessarily go without. """"They may have to seek their immunizations elsewhere, such as through their regular doctor,"""" Williams said. And what would happen to the other 56,000 children? Williams said the agency expects that they would still be able to receive immunizations at public health clinics, but she did not specify how that would be accomplished. """"We likely will have to fill in the gap with vaccine from other resources, possibly federal sources,"""" she said, because state dollars alone may not be able to cover all of them. Upshot: There's a 56,000 difference between the number of children Villarreal said would no longer get immunized and the number of children the agency says could no longer be served at public health clinics if the proposed budget cut happens. Asked to explain the discrepancy, Villarreal told us by e-mail that he issued his September statement after his office discussed the August budget cut proposal with agency officials. """"At that time, they communicated to us that the proposal would end funding for 113,000 children and about half of them could be expected to find services elsewhere,"""" Villarreal said. """"That's what I said in the first two sentences of my press release. The agency now says that we misunderstood. The point is the same either way: A very large number of our children would be left without immunizations."""" We asked Williams about that early September conversation between a Villarreal staffer and Nick Dauster, director of the agency's Government Affairs Unit. She said: """"There must have been a misunderstanding between what was said and what was heard in a phone call a couple months ago. Admittedly, it’s a complex topic that involves estimates and unknowns, and our early information could have been clearer, which is why we provided clarification."""" The """"clarification"""" was an e-mail sent from Dauster to Peter Clark, Villarreal's legislative director, on Sept. 1 — before Villarreal issued his press release — saying that """"an estimated 56,000 children could be affected"""" by the cut in immunization funding. """"This represents children who receive immunization services normally paid for by general revenue,"""" Dauster wrote. Finally, we explored whether it makes sense to ascribe the agency-level proposal to the Perry """"administration,"""" as Villarreal's statement does. By law, the governor appoints the chief executives as well as the governing boards of some major agencies, including the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, whose Perry-appointed executive commissioner chooses the commissioner of the health services department in consultation with the governor. Also, Williams told us that the health services staff put together its budget reduction proposals with input from commission overseers. We asked Stephanie Goodman, a commission spokeswoman, if it was accurate to characterize the health services department ideas as """"Perry administration proposals."""" Her response: """"No. Our staff developed the options."""" She said the governor's office wasn't involved in deciding what cuts to propose. And how does Villarreal's statement that the Perry administration proposes ending immunizations for 113,000 kids shape up? We'll take his reference to the """"Perry administration"""" as a defensible poke. And a state agency has proposed ending most of the general revenue funding for immunizations for that many kids. However, the suggestion that none of those 113,000 children would get vaccinated misstates the estimated impact of the proposed $7.7 million budget cut. While the state acknowledges that half the children would no longer be served under the immunization program — and some of those may have insurance coverage — it expects the rest would still get their shots at public health clinics. However, it says it doesn't yet know exactly how those immunizations would be paid for.

But there are many big steps that must be taken in the research process before that prediction can play out in reality.", ,"No discussion of cost. If a story can claim that something “may soon be” available, it ought to be able to project cost. Of course, it’s probably way too early to project anything meaningful on either count, but therein lies the weakness in such story framing. The story stated that the researchers “were able to correctly diagnose 14 cases where there were extra copies of the chromosome and 26 normal fetuses.” No discussion of potential harms – of sensitivity and specificity issues that can only be established in a much larger trial. The need for a larger trial was mentioned, but no hint of unestablished potential harms. The story never mentioned the limitation of drawing conclusions from such a small study. Granted, it stated that “the test now needed to be trialed in a larger study of about 1,000 pregnancies” but then concluded “that could lead to changed in clinical practice within two years. That’s a very enthusastic claim for a very aggressive timetable. No disease mongering. No independent perspective, which was sorely needed – especially regarding predictions of availability and impact on the field. The story didn’t even mention any of the other research being done in this field to improve prenatal diagnosis. Allowing researchers to claim that a test “may soon be” available after a study in just 40 pregnancies is not wise journalism. If the story had turned to an independent expert, perhaps this enthusiasm may have been put into a better perspective. The path to commercialization is likely years in the making. The story didn’t explain that the test used in the study is actually a group of existing tests. And it didn’t even mention any of the other research being done in this field to improve prenatal diagnosis.

Health officials say contract tracing has revealed many new cases stem from bars, parties and other events where social distancing is not being maintained, particularly among residents in their 20s.",Eric Litke,"""After an extended period of mostly positive trends, COVID-19 is making a resurgence in America. At least 21 states were pausing reopening plans or taking new steps to limit the virus as of June 30, USA TODAY reported. In Wisconsin, new cases rose noticeably the last two weeks of June after falling steadily in the first half of the month. The reversal has led to an increased push for mask usage and other measures to limit the spread. But one Wisconsin lawmaker said a step like mandating masks isn't needed, pointing in part to the number of tests being conducted. """"The cases are going up, but it's because the testing is going up,"""" Sen. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, said in an interview with WISN-TV on June 29, 2020. """"The hospitalization rate is still within the comfort zone of every single hospital."""" We’ll focus on the first part of this phrase, since the interplay of testing and case trends is critical to understanding what the virus is doing in our state. Essentially, Kapenga is blaming the increase only on the volume of tests. Here’s why that’s wrong. Wisconsin isn’t seeing a surge as significant as some states in the South, but the cases are clearly rising. The seven-day average of new cases was around 270 in mid-June, but it rose to more than 400 by late June when Kapenga made his statement. The seven-day average is the best judge of general trends since it smooths out the daily stats, which can jump up and down for a variety of reasons. But Kapenga’s reasoning fails on two fronts. First, this ignores the more detailed stats that show what is actually driving the increase. Experts say people here are letting their guard down, particularly residents in their 20s who went from 20% of the state’s positive tests before June 22 to 40% after that date. They point to the increasing willingness — in that age group and others — to get together at bars, parties and other social events. Contact tracing has confirmed these get-togethers as an increasingly common source of COVID-19 infections. The trend has spurred officials in Madison to order bars to close again. Second, his basic premise is flat wrong — testing isn’t going up. The seven-day average of daily tests in Wisconsin peaked at 12,000 on June 9 and has marched steadily downward since. The average was just over 9,000 on June 29 when Kapenga made his claim. Throughout May, new cases and testing volume both generally rose. But the trends separated after that. And in the last half of June new cases rose as testing dropped. The seven-day average of daily tests in Wisconsin peaked at 12,000 on June 9 and has marched steadily downward since. The average was just over 9,000 on June 29 when Kapenga made his claim. In a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Kapenga said his full comments to WISN focused on hospitalizations, which have continued to drop throughout June. """"The interview was largely about face mask mandates and not a detailed analysis of testing data and trends,"""" Kapenga said. """"This statement was a generality and not intended to be a commentary on any new trend beginning at that time of the interview."""" Addressing rising COVID-19 case counts in Wisconsin, Kapenga said measures like mandatory mask use aren’t necessary because cases are rising due to increased testing. That’s flat wrong. Experts say there are clear drivers to the recent uptick, like residents in their 20s largely ignoring social distancing. So Kapenga’s attempt to minimize the trend to a result of testing frequency is misguided. Most notably, Kapenga’s core premise is simply not accurate. Testing was dropping, not rising, in late June as cases rose. He defended his claim as a """"generality,"""" but it’s a generality that hasn’t been true since May.""","https://projects.jsonline.com/topics/coronavirus/tracking/covid-19-cases-testing-and-deaths-in-wisconsin.html, https://www.wisn.com/article/coronavirus-wisconsin-unlikely-to-issue-statewide-face-mask-mandate/33004061, https://www.jsonline.com/in-depth/news/2020/07/01/coronavirus-up-young-wisconsin-people-protests-bars-blame-spread/3278490001/, https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/30/covid-cases-states-pausing-reopening-plans-list/3284513001/",false,"Public Health, Wisconsin, Coronavirus, Chris Kapenga, "

We can’t say for sure that the Facebook post doesn’t show a woman whose arms were burned from a hand sanitizer-induced flame. The post has the ingredients of a hoax, however. For starters, we were unable to identify the original source of the photo through reverse image searches on Google, TinEye and Yandex. Our searches on Google and Nexis for related news reports also turned up no results, whereas other sanitizer mishaps have been widely covered. Fact-checkers in India and online bloggers suggested the wounds in the photo were the result of skin grafting, a surgical procedure in which healthy skin is transplanted onto a new part of the body. But Andrew Vardanian, assistant clinical professor of plastic and reconstructive surgery at UCLA and a plastic surgeon at UCLA Health, told us the image looked to him like a second-degree burn — and likely not one that came from hand sanitizer. """"The straight line on the left arm is too straight for this to have happened from hand sanitizer, he said. """"It is more consistent with a submersion type burn into something that caused a scald."""" Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are flammable, which is why the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, the World Health Organization and major manufacturers like Purell all offer fire safety warnings for use. Travelers typically can’t carry large amounts on planes. But while bottles and dispensers of hand sanitizer are recommended to be stored away from flames, the CDC and the WHO both say the incidence of fire from use is """"very low."""" A WHO webpage says that the benefits """"in terms of infection prevention far outweigh the fire risks."""" Proper application and use mitigates the fire risks, experts told us. """"The directions for alcohol based sanitizers often state to rub it into your hands until they are dry, which would reduce the fire risk because the flammable liquid and vapors would evaporate,"""" said Jeffrey Gardner, associate professor of biological sciences at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. """"Once a person’s hands are dry, the fire risk would dramatically decrease."""" """"If properly applied with hands rubbed together until the liquid evaporates, it shouldn't burst into flame,"""" added Michael Gochfeld, professor emeritus of clinical research and occupational medicine at Rutgers University. It takes about 20 seconds of rubbing for hand sanitizer to fully dry on your hands, according to the CDC and the WHO. Vardanian said surgeons often use flammable products to sterilize the skin before surgery, but he said """"we wait for a few minutes until we start draping to prevent these types of injuries."""" """"If someone used massive amounts of hand sanitizer and then contacted a flame, there may be a fire and a burn can result from this,"""" he said of the Facebook post.

The claim we’re checking here is from an article shared from the website of Rangitikei Environmental Health Watch. That article is actually an excerpt of an article by conservative website TruePundit. Both articles cite an interview given by private investigators John Moynihan and Larry Doyle on a TruePundit podcast in which the investigators said that representatives from the Gates Foundation met with U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., in Rwanda, East Africa, in mid August 2019 """"to hash out who would score the windfall from a government contact tracing program."""" The article points out that, in May, Rush introduced the $100 billion Testing, Reaching and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act to fight the coronavirus. Our searches of Google and Nexis turned up no reports of a meeting in Rwanda between Rush and the Gates Foundation. A philanthropic organization interested in issues of global health and education, the Gates Foundation has pledged millions of dollars to companies developing potential novel coronavirus vaccines. But there is no evidence that the foundation stands to profit from these efforts. Moynihan and Doyle previously claimed to have found financial wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation. But when appearing before a House hearing in December 2018, they refused to submit what they said were 6,000 pages of documents. As we’ve reported, the Trace Act was introduced by Rush in May. It would provide $100 billion in grants in the current fiscal year to faith-based organizations, clinics, medical centers and other organizations that perform testing for COVID–19, do contact tracing or provide services for individuals who are isolating at home. Contact tracing is a process that tasks public health workers with learning as much as they can about whom an infected patient has been in contact with, so they can be notified about their potential exposure. The bill stands a 4% chance of passage, according to a service used by GovTrack.us., which tracks federal legislation. The Gates Foundation sent PolitiFact this response: """"This claim is .""""

38099," U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), while undergoing taxpayer-funded cancer treatments, voted to end cancer treatments for Medicare beneficiaries. ","December 14, 2017",Sen. John McCain Votes to End Cancer Treatments for Medicare Beneficiaries ,  Rich Buhler & Staff  ,"John McCain voted in support of the GOP’s tax reform bill, which experts warn could trigger Medicare spending cuts. But McCain did not “vote to end cancer treatments for Medicare beneficiaries,” as has been claimed. If the GOP tax plan is enacted, and $1.5 trillion in unfunded tax cuts trigger pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) budget rules, the bill could trigger mandatory Medicare spending cuts. However, that hasn’t yet happened. So claims that John McCain voted to end cancer treatments for Medicare beneficiaries are mostly fiction. Does GOP Tax Plan End Medicare Cancer Treatments? Again, the GOP tax plan does not outline specific Medicare cuts. And John McCain did not vote for a bill to end cancer treatments for medicare beneficiaries. But a statutory budget rule known as “PAYGO” could trigger mandatory spending cuts to certain programs, including Medicare. The PAYGO rule requires across-the-board mandatory cuts to non-exempt federal programs when legislation increases the deficit over a five- or ten-year budget window without any offsets. The $1.5 trillion cost of the GOP’s tax plan would trigger the PAYGO rule, and the result would be up to  $28 billion in Medicare cuts in 2018. By 2027, the mandatory 4 percent cut (or sequester) to Medicare would grow to $56 billion, the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget reports. However, John McCain (and other senators) could avert the PAYGO rule. The Senate could pass a budget resolution that exempts specific legislation (the tax reform bill) from the PAYGO rule. Another method would be for Congress to change how federal spending is scored. Dynamic scoring, which takes into account economic growth resulting from spending, could prevent the GOP tax plan from triggering PAYGO. Check out our previous coverage of dynamic scoring vs. static scoring of the GOP tax plan here. So, the GOP tax plan could trigger 4 percent Medicare spending cuts under the PAYGO rule. But it’s not clear if that will happen. It’s also not clear if John McCain would support a bill that ends Medicare cancer treatments. Would John McCain Support a Bill Ending Medicare Cancer Treatments? John McCain announced on Nov. 30 that he would support the GOP tax reform plan. The senator called the bill “far from perfect,” but said it would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy and provide tax relief. McCain’s statement didn’t reference Medicare cuts. His statement did, however, voice support for health care reform. More specifically, McCain supported repealing the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate (which the GOP tax plan would accomplish). Medical groups argue that ending the individual mandate could lead to widespread loss of cancer treatment coverage for Americans who rely on ACA plans. But it’s not clear that the GOP’s tax reform bill would eliminate Medicare cancer treatments — even if PAYGO rule cuts go into effect. AARP said an immediate $25 billion reduction in Medicare funding would affect payments to doctors and hospitals that care for Medicare beneficiaries: The $25 billion reduction would affect the payments that doctors, hospitals and other health care providers receive for treating Medicare patients. Individual benefits would not change and neither would premiums, deductibles or copays. But with so much less money going to providers, the cuts could have major impacts on patient access to health care — such as fewer physicians accepting Medicare patients. And Medicare’s coverage of cancer treatment typically comes from Medicare Part A, Medicare Part B and Medicare Advantage. Beneficiaries have to enroll in these programs and (most) have to pay additional premiums. It’s not clear at this time how Medicare sequester cuts would impact Medicare Part A, Part B or Medicare Advantage plans. While the GOP tax reform bill could trigger Medicare cuts, that hasn’t happened yet. Additionally, it’s not clear how (or if) those cuts would impact coverage of cancer treatments.

Then again, 32 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients and 26 percent said they limit such patients--signaling that 58 percent of physicians accept at least some new Medicaid patients. By not specifying that the cited """"three in 10"""" reflects only doctors who accept all new Medicaid patients, Perry’s statement falls off target by nearly 30 percent. Still, it has en element of truth.""",W. Gardner Selby,"""Saying Medicaid is a broken system that should not be expanded in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry and the state’s U.S. senators suggested many physicians decline to serve patients insured by the state-federal program. In an April 1, 2013, press release issued in conjunction with their joint Texas Capitol press conference, Perry and Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, all Republicans, said that nationally, Medicaid expenditures surged from 1990 to 2010, outpacing its caseload. Also, their press release said: """"Only three in 10 Texas doctors are currently accepting new Medicaid patients."""" Elaborating in the press conference, Perry said: """"And we fear that number may actually decrease if expansion went through."""" The 3-in-10 claim, brought to our attention by analyst Anne Dunkelberg of Austin’s liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, sounded familiar, especially after spokespeople for Perry and each senator said by email that it was based on a 2012 survey of Texas physicians by the Texas Medical Association. Preliminary results from the survey figured into one of our fact checks earlier this year. Final survey results are now compiled, Donna Kinney, the association’s lead researcher, told us by phone. Kinney said the results break out to 32 percent of Texas physicians saying they accept all new Medicaid patients and 42 percent declining all new Medicaid patients--with 26 percent limiting their new Medicaid patients. Put another way, the final results indicate that about four in 10 Texas physicians decline all new Medicaid patients while about six in 10 accept at least some new patients. """"They may accept them only in the emergency room,"""" Kinney speculated. """"The limits could be anything."""" Early this year, we rated the association’s claim that only 31 percent of Texas physicians accept all new Medicaid patients, compared with 67 percent in 2000. The group’s Twitter post about the figure was missing clarification that the figure came from a survey. At the time, though, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission told us that some 67 percent of the state’s physicians had accepted Medicaid at least once during a recent 12-month period. Agency spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman told us by email that 34,290 Texas physicians had claims paid by Medicaid in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. According to the Texas Medical Board, there were nearly 51,000 practicing physicians in the state at about that time. Goodman said then that she did not have information on the share of physicians not accepting all new Medicaid patients. Brent Annear, a medical association spokesman, guided us to a March 2012 web post by the group stating that 27,917 physicians and medical residents were asked to fill out its online survey and the group fielded 1,139 responses, a 4 percent response rate. The group’s """"preliminary findings"""" document says the respondents were a """"representative sample"""" of all physicians. The survey reached members and non-members, Kinney told us by email. The key question lists physician reimbursement methods including private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid. """"For patients covered by the following payers,"""" the question says, """"does your practice currently (1) accept all new patients, (2) limit new patients that you will accept, or (3) accept no new patients?"""" According to the final results, Kinney said, 32 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients. Some 26 percent said they limit their new Medicaid patients, and 42 percent said they decline all new Medicaid patients, compared with 32 percent in 2010. For our previous check, Annear said by email that physicians have difficulties with Medicaid’s rates and bureaucratic hurdles that delay payments. The rates decreased four times from 2000 to 2011, an association spokeswoman, Pam Udall, said by email, though the state also agreed to a 25-percent boost in funds covering certain physician services provided to children on Medicaid, as part of resolving a lawsuit. We asked Kinney to speculate on why nearly 70 percent of Texas physicians submitted at least one Medicaid claim in a recent year. She said about 60 percent of the state’s physicians--including many specialists in radiology, pathology and anesthesiology--must accept Medicaid to maintain their hospital admitting privileges. Those kinds of doctors would have responded to the survey by saying they limit new Medicaid patients, she said by phone. For a """"real-world"""" take, we ran the preliminary survey result by Austin opthalmologist Michelle Berger, the 2013 president of the Travis County Medical Society, which is affiliated with the medical association. Berger said by phone that the society frequently fields inquiries from individuals newly on Medicaid seeking a doctor. Berger said she stopped accepting new Medicaid patients in her practice because related paperwork proved onerous and government payments, which have not kept up with inflation, were not quickly forthcoming. Then again, she said, doctors who do not accept new Medicaid patients may still provide charity care--the result being that some low-income patients are served even though their doctors do not seek payment. Asked to appraise the Texas leaders’ declaration--that only three in 10 physicians accept new Medicaid patients--Kinney said: """"The language does matter. They should have said ‘all’"""" new patients. In emails, Perry spokesman Josh Havens and Cornyn spokeswoman Jessica Sandlin each said the leaders’ statement accurately reflected the association survey. Havens added that """"you cannot continue to add context to manipulate the result you want."""" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier, also standing by the claim, said by email that the point is that Medicaid is a broken system. Our ruling Perry said only three in 10 Texas doctors currently accept new Medicaid patients. In a recent year, some 67 percent of Texas physicians submitted at least one Medicaid claim. More recently, 42 percent of the state’s physicians responding to a 2012 survey said they refuse all new Medicaid patients.

10825,Pain Patches Making Gains in U.S.,"January 21, 2011","The story does include some commentary from some independent sources, and it does a good job placing the patches into the larger context of pain-relief traditions in other countries. But it does not carefully analyze the evidence supporting the use of these patches, does not quantify the benefits of their use, does not quantify the harms and does not provide any cost information. We’re baffled as to why this story was published (twice – 6 months apart) and why so many outlets picked it up. (Yahoo, iVillage, MSN, ScienceMagNews, countless TV stations, etc. Just do a web search on the headline to see dozens and dozens of re-posts.) Old news that didn’t get better with time, and still spreads like wildfire! Pain management is one of the most difficult areas of medicine. Patients who are in pain understandably will try any number of measures to seek relief. Good physicians, including the ones quoted in this story, tend to take a cautious approach, attempting to manage pain treatment holistically to avoid turning a pain sufferer into a pain medicine addict. Stories about various pain relief methods need to make it clear why one method might be an advance over another and why some methods might work better for short-term pain sufferers versus chronic pain patients. This story did neither.", ,"There is no mention of costs. At CVS.com, a box of five patches costs $7.99. This isn’t high for short-term use, but if you are a chronic pain sufferer (a category not addressed in this story) you might run through a box or two per day. Regardless, costs should have been mentioned. The story alludes to the benefits but never attempts to back them up with data. “The patches also deliver their medicine directly to the site of a person’s pain. This may eliminate some of the side effects that come with taking pills. For instance, some analgesics are likely to cause an upset stomach unless they’re taken with food. … And, because patches release their medication slowly into the body through the skin, people also should get more consistent pain relief than they do with pills.” Note that in the previous sentences, there are no declarative statements about benefits. “This may eliminate,” the story says. “People also should get more,” it says. Is the story hedging because of a lack of evidence or because the evidence was never reviewed? No harms are quantified. Instead, the story relies on quotes that merely mention side effects. Interestingly, the story gives more space to the possibility of a skin reaction from the patches than it does the more serious potential harm. In one sentence it says, “On the other hand, people have to be sure to carefully follow instructions for using the patches, to avoid overdose.”  The story should have given some estimate of how often that’s happened. The story makes no attempt to evaluate the quality of the evidence supporting (or not supporting) the use of pain patches. Indeed, it does not even mention whether there have been any studies showing the benefits of these pain patches. We know that there had to be at least a few clinical trials or the pain patches would not have been approved. Some mention of how those trials were conducted would have been nice to see, at a minimum. The story may lead the reader to think minor aches deserve treatment with a medication when, in fact, they might not benefit from any medication. The story does not exaggerate the numbers of people suffering from the condition under discussion, but, perhaps worse, it ignores the question completely. Not only do we have no idea how prevalent the problem is, there is no delineation of what type of “ache” this nostrum treats. It it good for a minor bruise? What about torn ligaments? Stress fractures? Metastases? When it is left to the reader’s imagination to select the disease, there is disease-mongering. This is exactly what vague advertisements for drugs hope to achieve. They plant the seed in the patient’s mind that there might be help for whatever problem they have. The story quotes some independent sources. We just wish the story had made better use of these sources. Why not ask them to help quantify the benefits and harms? Why not have them discuss some of the alternatives to sticking a patch on the affected area? Alternatives are barely mentioned, and no non-pharmaceutical alternatives are mentioned. “Both doctors said that they expect more over-the-counter pain patches to hit the market if the popularity of Salonpas continues to grow. Future over-the-counter options, they predicted, could include reduced-dosage versions of the NSAID-delivering patches now available through prescription. “Success begets success,” Dombrowski said. “If this does very well, other drug companies will say, ‘I want a piece of this action. '””  Readers are left with the message that people are running out to buy these pain patches because they work, and that more companies are going to be making these patches because they are so beneficial. But there is no proof provided in this story of their success or their benefits. There is no evidence conveyed that the patch is better than nothing, let alone existing, accepted treatments. From a business story standpoint, this story fails. From a medical story standpoint, the story is incredibly misleading. The story makes it clear that pain-relief patches have been used in some form for decades while only recently becoming popular in the US. “The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the country’s first over-the-counter, pain-relieving transdermal patches in 2008. But the patches, marketed under the brand name Salonpas, are nothing new. They’ve been sold in various countries in Asia since the 1930s, according to their manufacturer, the Japanese firm Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical.” The story started out in a promising way, by showing that pain patches are commonly used in other countries. One of the quoted experts says that the US is simply late in beginning to use them: “If you are an Asian kid, you’ve had these placed on you since time immemorial,” he said. “It’s just now starting to hit more mainstream in the United States. They’re gaining more acceptance.” They are not novel and have been available by prescription. The story, helpfully, explains that “active ingredients include such medications as lidocaine, capsaicin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. The active ingredients in Salonpas are methyl salicylate and menthol, common components of pain-relieving gels and creams, such as Bengay.” This is all good context. The story does not rely on a news release.",http://www.google.com/search?q=pain patches making gains in us&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a#q=pain patches making gains in us&hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=jfk&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&prmd=ivns&ei=E3E8Td6OEYWBlAetzdyABw&start=0&sa=N&fp=8ce0e008a607e93d,false,"HealthDay,Pain management"

In fact, Sellman’s """"silver solution,"""" and colloidal silver, can hurt you, and not just your wallet.""",Julia Garlich,"""As the novel coronavirus pandemic continues to spread, so does misinformation surrounding the illness, heightening global anxiety. On March 10, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt (R) filed a lawsuit against televangelist Jim Bakker and his production company for advertising and marketing a silver solution that he and his guest, Sherill Sellman, falsely implied could cure coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During the broadcast, naturopathic doctor Sherill Sellman claimed the silver solution had killed other viruses. Coronavirus is a family of viruses. Other notable outbreaks have been SARS and MERS. """"Well, let's say it hasn't been tested on this strain of the coronavirus, but it has been tested on other strains of the coronavirus and has been able to eliminate it within 12 hours,"""" Sellman said. """"Totally eliminate it. Kills it. Deactivates it."""" As Sellman spoke, a message appeared on the bottom of the screen advertising the sale of four, 4-ounce bottles of the silver solution for $80. So, is there any silver solution that kills any strain of coronavirus? In a word: No. On March 9, the Food and Drug Administration issued warning statements to seven companies, including the Jim Bakker Show, informing them to stop selling products they claimed cure the coronavirus. The products cited in the letter were teas, essential oils, tinctures and colloidal silver, according to the FDA news release. This wasn’t the Jim Bakker Show’s first warning. On March 3, New York Attorney General Letitia James’s office sent a cease and desist letter to Bakker for misleading the public about the effectiveness of the silver solution as a cure for the novel disease. We reached out to Sellman to see what actually was in this silver substance, but never got a response. One ingredient, though, is colloidal silver, a liquid that contains silver particles. Often it is peddled as an immune boosting, disease curing dietary supplement, but there is no scientific evidence to back up these claims. In fact, colloidal silver can be dangerous to your health. Its side effects include permanently turning your skin a bluish-gray and causing poor absorption of certain drugs and antibiotics, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Coronaviruses, known for their crown-like spikes, are a large family of viruses that can be found in many different types of animals including cattle and bats. Rarely, the coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and create new human coronaviruses that make people sick. There are seven strains of coronavirus that can infect people, and most people get cold-like symptoms. Three strains, including COVID-19, can cause acute respiratory distress and spread rapidly. While much about the pandemic causing disease is still unknown here’s what scientists do know: """"COVID-19 spreads between people who have been in close contact or through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes."""" """"Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure and include fever, a cough and shortness of breath.""""

Hospitalizations were down from a week prior but flat the week before the claim.",Eric Litke,"""As tends to happen in Wisconsin politics these days, the battle over re-opening the state is headed to the courts. The state’s Republican-led Legislature filed suit April 21, 2020, asking the Wisconsin Supreme Court to stop Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration from extending the stay-at-home order into late May. Evers had issued a """"Safer at Home"""" order March 24, 2020, that restricted movement and business activity throughout the state through April 24. On April 16 that order was extended to May 26, 2020, this time signed by Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald made their case for an injunction blocking Palm in a joint statement released the same day as the lawsuit. After referencing """"public outcry"""" and condemning Evers for """"unprecedented administrative overreach,"""" the three-paragraph statement ends with this: """"The constant stream of executive orders … are eroding both the economy and their liberty even as the state is clearly seeing a decline in COVID infections."""" We’ll leave the determinations on scope of authority to the courts, but the last bit of that is clearly a data-based claim. Are infections """"clearly"""" on the decline in Wisconsin? At the time of the joint statement, COVID-19 had resulted in 242 deaths in Wisconsin, with 4,620 people testing positive for the disease. Kit Beyer, a spokeswoman for Vos, said the decline claim was based on hospitalization data and the hospital resource usage estimated in a model by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The oft-cited model, last updated April 17, projected Wisconsin’s peak resource usage to be somewhere between April 10 and April 18. It’s an estimate based on their formula, not a firm calculation based on actual figures. The model has drawn some criticism for its methodology, which experts say could make it ill-suited to help determine when to ease social distancing restrictions. In any case, it doesn’t make much sense to rely on a predictive model when we have actual data to examine for Wisconsin. So we’ll do that, starting with the hospitalization numbers Beyer cited. So here’s what we found looking at both recent days and the full month of April. HOSPITALIZATIONS This is the lone metric that shows a decline over the last couple weeks. After rising to start the month, the daily tally leveled off around 440 per day from April 9 to 14. The number then dropped for two days before holding steady between 357 and 361 from April 17 to 21. CONFIRMED CASES The daily numbers move up and down a bit but have stayed largely consistent throughout April. Zooming in to the last six days (April 15 to 20), Wisconsin had between 147 and 170 new confirmed cases per day. The tally was lower the days before that due to a lower number of tests being performed. The most recent tally released prior to the statement from Vos and Fitzgerald was April 20, with 153 cases, up six from the day before. That’s on par with the April average of 157 new cases per day. DEATHS Wisconsin has averaged 10.7 coronavirus deaths per day throughout April, with daily tallies ranging from six to 19. The week prior to the statement from Vos and Fitzgerald, Wisconsin averaged 10.9 deaths, including 10 on April 20. Vos and Fitzgerald said the state is """"clearly seeing a decline in COVID infections."""" There are a lot of ways to slice the coronavirus data, but this is an exaggeration. New cases and deaths in the week before this claim were roughly in line with both the preceding week and the averages for the month of April.

11464,Gene Therapy Shows Potential Against Heart Failure,"November 16, 2010","Are we really going to report commonly now when early research moves from one phase into another? What researchers announced was that a year after a very small number of heart failure patients were given a type of gene therapy intended to improve how their heart muscles manage calcium cycling there appear to be enough indications of relative benefits and safety to move ahead to a phase 3 trial that would be capable of providing more reliable evidence of clinical effects. What’s more, the key conclusions of this trial were announced at another heart failure meeting last summer. This presentation just updated the statistics with a few more months of data. Instead of asking probing questions of researchers, the story relies on quotes from a news release. Instead of getting comments from independent sources that illuminate the specific strengths and weaknesses of this trial, the story just passes along general statements about heart failure and the preliminary nature of research. At least the story discloses the use of prepared statements and it notes that the company developing this gene therapy funded the trial. Earlier reports about this trial highlighted questions about the statistical methods used by the researchers in this trial… and words of caution about reading too much into the findings. This story could have done a better job explaining to readers that this trial was capable only of determining whether or not this gene therapy is ready for the next phase of testing – and that it cannot settle questions about whether the therapy is safe and effective.", ,"Although this gene therapy has barely begun the long road of clinical trials and so we won’t hold this story to the expectation that it discuss costs, the story could have offered readers at least some general comments about how the costs of this sort of gene therapy might compare with conventional treatments for heart failure. This story doesn’t seem to distinguish between “getting better” and “not declining as fast.” As one line states, “At both six months and a year later, the patients who had received the new gene saw their risk for death, cardiac transplantation, worsening heart failure and hospitalization decline by half.” That sentence seems to say that the patients had lower risks than before they enrolled in trial, when what researchers actually reported was that the patients given the gene therapy were only half as likely as the patients who got a placebo to have one of those bad events. The story reports only relative benefits without telling readers the absolute numbers. One result reported in a company news release was particularly striking, that during the year following treatment, the average number of days spent in the hospital was 0.4 per patient for the 9 patients who got the highest dose and 4.5 days per patient for the 14 who received a placebo. The story could have at least included the actual numbers of deaths reported in each group. The story does not mention any harms. Even though the researchers said in their meeting abstract that the therapy had “an excellent safety profile” in this trial, the story should have pointed out that patients have been harmed and some have died during experiments using other types of gene therapy. The story falls short in accurately describing both the big picture and key details. For instance, the lead sentence says the gene therapy partially restored “the heart’s ability to pump in 39 heart failure patients.” But 39 patients was the total number enrolled in the trial. Of those, 14 received a placebo. Of the 25 who received the gene therapy, only 9 were given the high dose that produced results the researchers highlighted. As for the big picture, not only was the purpose of this trial limited to determining if the therapy appears to be safe and effective enough in order to be given to a much larger number of patients in a trial capable of producing convincing evidence of clinical effects, but the statistical methods used have sparked debate among observers. Following the release of shorter-term results last summer, one independent observer was quoted as having reservations about the way the trial defined improvement, which he said had never been used before and hadn’t been well validated. The generic statement in the story that results are preliminary and need more investigation isn’t enough to put the sketchy nature of these results into the proper context for readers. At least the story included a standard disclaimer that “research presented at meetings isn’t subjected to the same level of scrutiny as studies published in peer-reviewed journals.” See “CUPID: First-in-human gene therapy for advanced heart failure promising in small study” available at http://www.theheart.org/article/1083549.do Although a quote from one of the researchers and another line in the body of the story refer to patients with “advanced heart failure,” the headline and lead of the story refer to just “heart failure,” which includes a far broader range of people. A company news release defined the trial participants has having moderate to severe heart failure and significantly impaired pumping function of their hearts and less than half the normal ability to transport and utilize oxygen during exercise testing. The story should have been clear from the top about the severity of disease in the participants in this trial. A single additional sentence would have gone a long way in addressing this. The story does quote two independent experts and reports that the trial was funded by the company developing this gene therapy. Unfortunately, those experts’ quotes didn’t add much to help readers evaluate the quality and value of this trial. But it nonetheless gets a barely passing grade on this criterion. Other than saying that one goal of this line of research is to provide an alternative to heart transplants, the story does not describe the alternative treatments available to people with heart failure. For example, even when drug therapy loses its effectiveness, some heart failure patients are receiving heart assist pumps for long-term use… so there are approved alternatives to a heart transplant for some patients like those in this trial. The story should have included that fact. The story clearly states that this gene therapy is experimental and not available to patients. This gene therapy technique is indeed something new, but the story would have been better if it had included some independent assessment of a researcher’s claim that, “This is the first time gene therapy has been tested and shown to improve outcomes for patients with advanced heart failure.” Also, the researchers reported very similar results at other heart failure meetings last summer. The story does not make clear that this latest announcement merely adds a few more months of follow-up, not entirely new results. At least the story discloses that the quotes from the lead research are taken from a university news release.", ,false,HealthDay

Trump administration officials say the change will streamline data gathering, but the HHS database is not open to the public, which could affect the work of health officials who relied on the CDC database, the New York Times reported. The Facebook post we’re checking was published July 21. The same day, the same claim was made in a tweet by former congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine. Lorraine, a pro-Trump Republican, finished last among five candidates in the 2020 primary for the U.S. House seat held by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. In a reply to her tweet, Lorraine cited what she said were the """"sources"""" for a her claim, including: a report that a Florida motorcyclist’s death had been added to the COVID-19 and then was removed; a partially debunked claim that hospitals are paid $13,000 for the admission of a COVID-19 patient and $39,000 if the patient goes on a ventilator; and her own statement that the CDC has admitted that it includes pneumonia and seasonal flu in its count of COVID-19 cases. Bob Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told PolitiFact that similar claims were made in June. """"The claim was  then and is still  now. I’m not even sure where those numbers come from. They seem to have been pulled out of thin air,"""" he said.

Cases that involve pneumonia or flu but not COVID-19 are not included in COVID-19 counts, McDonald said. However, a case would be included if, for example, a patient gets pneumonia that was caused by COVID-19, Anderson said.

11942,"""Edward Markey Says HIV and AIDS rates have spiked """"due to increased heroin and fentanyl use.""","October 31, 2017","""Markey said, HIV and AIDS rates have spiked """"due to increased heroin and fentanyl use."""" There are risks for HIV transmission among people who share needles and syringes to inject opioids. An Indiana county recently had an HIV outbreak linked to the injection of opioids, including heroin. At least 220 U.S. counties may be at risk of similar outbreaks. But the CDC said it does not have national data addressing Markey’s heroin and fentanyl claim, and estimates that HIV and AIDs diagnoses have declined in recent years among people who inject drugs. Markey’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""",Miriam Valverde,"""Democratic Sen. Edward J. Markey said that the Trump administration’s plan to use funds from HIV and AIDS programs to fight the opioid addiction crisis is unsound. Specifically, the Massachusetts senator said that increased opioid abuse has led to an increase in HIV and AIDS. The administration’s Oct. 26 declaration of the opioid epidemic as a national public health emergency allows flexibility in the use of resources in HIV and AIDS programs to allow people eligible for those programs to get substance abuse treatment. """"The administration’s proposal to reallocate funding from HIV/AIDS programs to the opioid crisis is robbing Peter to pay Paul, especially as HIV and AIDS rates spike due to increased heroin and fentanyl use,"""" Markey said in an Oct. 26 statement. We wanted to know if increased use of heroin and fentanyl have led to increased rates of HIV and AIDS. We found some truth to Markey’s claim but not enough national data to fully back it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told us it does not have data specific to heroin and fentanyl, and estimates that HIV and AIDs diagnoses have declined in recent years among people who inject drugs. Still, there are risks associated with opioid injections and HIV transmissions, as was the case in an Indiana county. More than 64,000 people died in 2016 from drug overdoses, the majority linked to opioids, which include the synthetic opioid fentanyl and the illicit drug heroin, according to the CDC. Increased availability, a relatively low price and the high purity of heroin in the United States are driving increased use of heroin, the CDC said. Fentanyl use, including illicitly-made fentanyl, has also increased in recent years. People who inject drugs are at risk for infectious diseases that can be transmitted through used needles and syringes. Human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is most commonly acquired or transmitted through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use. If not treated, HIV can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. The CDC’s HIV Surveillance Report, 2015, noted that HIV and AIDS diagnoses tied to injection drug use declined from 2010 to 2015. The report did not specify diagnoses by types of drugs injected. From 2008 to 2014, estimated annual HIV infections among people who inject drugs declined 56 percent (from 3,900 to 1,700), according to February 2017 data from the CDC. That report did not include AIDS data. Experts we reached said they were not aware of reports showing a national spike in HIV and AIDS among injection drug users, but noted that data collection and reporting tends to lag. """"It is very possible that increased HIV transmission due to fentanyl and/or heroin use is occurring"""" but have not yet been identified through HIV testing and screening or have not yet been reported to CDC, said Brandon Marshall, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health. When we contacted Markey’s office, they highlighted reports about HIV spikes in Scott County. Scott County historically had fewer than five cases of HIV infection reported annually, CDC reported. By April 21, 2015, Indiana officials had diagnosed HIV in 135 people in a small community within Scott County. Most of them reported injection drug use with oxymorphone as their drug of choice, said CDC’s May 2015 report, adding that some reported injecting heroin. Since early 2015, at least 191 people had tested positive for HIV in Scott County, the Indiana State Department of Health said in April 2016. """"The outbreak in Scott County turned a floodlight on the intertwined nature of opioid use, HIV, and (hepatitis C virus) … It’s possible that the opioid epidemic could already be having a similar impact in other communities,"""" said a June blog post by Richard Wolitski, director of the office of HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Policy at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A CDC analysis published November 2016 found that at least 220 counties in 26 states are """"potentially vulnerable"""" to HIV and hepatitis C infections among persons who inject drugs """"in the context of the national opioid epidemic."""" Markey said, HIV and AIDS rates have spiked """"due to increased heroin and fentanyl use."""" There are risks for HIV transmission among people who share needles and syringes to inject opioids. An Indiana county recently had an HIV outbreak linked to the injection of opioids, including heroin. At least 220 U.S. counties may be at risk of similar outbreaks. But the CDC said it does not have national data addressing Markey’s heroin and fentanyl claim, and estimates that HIV and AIDs diagnoses have declined in recent years among people who inject drugs.

38917, Many people have questioned whether ads for a weight loss supplement called Garcinia Cambogia are real. ,"July 2, 2015",Weight Loss Claims About Garcinia Cambogia,  Rich Buhler & Staff  ,"There’s no proof that Garcinia cambogia can help you lose weight without diet and exercise, so this one is fiction. Garcinia cambogia is a fruit that grows in Southeast Asia. Dietary supplement companies regularly claim that it’s an appetite suppressant that also prevents the body from making fat. So, supposedly, the supplement can help you lose weight without diet or exercise. Garcinia cambogia got a major boost in November 2013 by “The Dr. Oz Show.” Dr. Oz said, “Thanks to brand new scientific research, I can tell you about a revolutionary fat buster. It’s called Garcinia cambogia.” As Dr. Oz delivered that intro, the words “No Exercise. No Diet. No Effort.” appeared on the screen behind him. Dr. Oz then interviewed a woman who said she lost 10 pounds thanks to Garcinia cambogia. But claims that Garcinia cambogia being a “miracle” dietary supplement have been disputed ever since. A 1998 study found that Garcinia cambogia didn’t help people lose weight. But a follow up analysis of numerous studies on any possible weight loss benefits concluded in 2013 that the supplement’s dietary benefits “remain to be proven.” A number of dietary supplement producers used the 2013 analysis to market Garcinia cambogia as a miracle supplement that could help people lose weight without diet or exercise — but those claims are unproven. A congressional panel later grilled Dr. Oz about his endorsement of unproven dietary supplements, and about his endorsement of Garcinia cambogia in particular, CNN reports: Oz testified Tuesday that he could not be held responsible for what certain companies say online about the products. He said he’s toned down some of his language and will publish a list of products he thinks really can help people lose weight. “To not have the conversation about supplements at all however would be a disservice to the viewer,” Oz said in a prepared statement after the hearing. “In addition to exercising an abundance of caution in discussing promising research and products in the future, I look forward to working with all those present today in finding a way to deal with the problems of weight loss scams.” The Food and Drug Administration does not regulate weight loss supplements. Under current law, companies selling these products do not need FDA approval before marketing them to the public. It’s important to note that the FDA does not regulate dietary supplements. That means companies don’t have to back up claims about “miracle” weight loss supplements like Garcina cambogia. And, right now, there’s no proof that Garcinia cambogia has any affect on weight loss at all.

24595,"""Ezekiel Emanuel, one of President Obama's key health care advisers, """"says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled. So watch out if you're disabled.""","August 12, 2009",Bachmann says Obama health adviser thinks health care ought not to be extended to the disabled,Robert Farley,"""Update: After we published this item, Ezekiel Emanuel responded at length to these claims in an interview with ABC News. See the interview  here  . You know Rahm Emanuel, President Barack Obama's intense chief of staff. And maybe you've heard of his brother, Ari Emanuel, a Hollywood talent agent who provided the inspiration for the Ari Gold character on HBO's  Entourage  . Now a third Emanuel brother, Ezekiel Emanuel, has been thrust into the spotlight. Ezekiel Emanuel is a health policy adviser at the White House Office of Management and Budget, and is a member of the Federal Council on Comparative Effectiveness Research, but until last week, he had largely flown under radar of the national political media. That changed when Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., made a statement from the floor of the House on July 27 in which she said the American public needed to know what the people who advise Obama about health care reform think. Specifically, she said, Dr. Emanuel """"says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled. So watch out if you're disabled."""" Emanuel is a well-known oncologist and bioethicist, which means he ponders such moral questions as """"You have three people who need a liver, but you've got just one liver, who gets it?"""" Like other academics (see our article on claims about science czar  John Holdren  ), Emanuel has found that highbrow articles for academic journals make great fodder for opponents trying to score political points. Academics often write theoretically about ideas that are being kicked around. And they repeat and explore those ideas, without necessarily endorsing them. Bachmann's comments from the House floor substantially repeat claims made in a July 24, 2009,  New York Post  op-ed piece written by Betsy McCaughey, former lieutenant governor of New York. Under the headline, """"Deadly Doctors: O Advisers Want to Ration Care,"""" McCaughey argues that """"Emanuel wants doctors to look beyond the needs of their patients and consider social justice, such as whether the money could be better spent on somebody else. """"Many doctors are horrified by this notion; they'll tell you that a doctor's job is to achieve social justice one patient at a time. """"Emanuel, however, believes that 'communitarianism' should guide decisions on who gets care. He says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled, not given to those 'who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens. . . . An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia.' (Hastings Center Report, Nov.-Dec. '96). """"Translation: Don't give much care to a grandmother with Parkinson's or a child with cerebral palsy."""" Bachmann quoted heavily from McCaughey's op-ed in her floor statement, and sprinkled in her own two cents. Here's what Bachmann said: """"The president's adviser, Dr. Emanuel, believes communitarianism should guide decisions on who gets care. He says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled. So watch out if you're disabled."""" She noted, """"We just lost my father-in-law to dementia two months ago. I thank God that the doctors were able to alleviate my poor father-in-law's symptoms at the end of his life at age 85. Apparently, under the Democrats' health care plan, my father-in-law would not have received the high quality of care that he received in his last two months of life. Or if you're a grandmother with Parkinson's or a child with cerebral palsy, watch out."""" The quote in question comes from an essay Emanuel wrote for the  Hastings Center Report  in the November-December 1996 issue. It ran under the title, """"Where Civic Republicanism and Deliberative Democracy Meet."""" The title alone should give you an idea of the kind of academic, philosophical discussion that will ensue. In the article, he addresses the idea of what's good for society at large when it comes to allocating health care resources, and that it """"suggests the need for public forums to deliberate about which health services should be considered basic and should be guaranteed."""" Under that philosophy, he writes, health services would be guaranteed to ensure the health of future generations as well as for """"full and active participation by citizens in public deliberations."""" That's the lead-in to the part that contains the stuff McCaughey cited: """"Conversely, services provided to individuals who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens are not basic and should not be guaranteed. An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia. A less obvious example is guaranteeing neuropsychological services to ensure children with learning disabilities can read and learn to reason."""" So the question is, is Emanuel saying that he thinks health services ought not to be guaranteed to patients with dementia? No, said Kenneth Baer, a spokesman for the White House Office of Budget and Management. """"He just unequivocally doesn't believe that."""" In fact, he said, one need look only as far as the next paragraph: """"Clearly more needs to be done to elucidate what specific health care services are basic; however, the overlap between liberalism and communitarianism points to a way of introducing the good back into medical ethics and devising a principled way of distinguishing basic from discretionary health care services."""" Yeah, we sorta got lost there too. What it means, Baer said, is that Emanuel was exploring different views of political theory as they apply to health care decisions and following one school of thought through to the point where he notes that it would lead to """"potentially disturbing types of policy ramifications."""" Furthermore, he said, you need to balance McCaughey's claim against Emanuel's 25-year record of caring for very sick people, and specifically providing quality care to very ill patients at the end of their life. """"He's a little surprised at how his record is being twisted and turned,"""" Baer said. """"It is preposterous that Ezekiel Emanuel would deny care to someone who needed it, or that he believes we should be making the sort of horrific medical decisions he's been accused of."""" Some of Emanuel's academic writing is confusing for nonacademics. But Emanuel has also written extensively in more mainstream media — the  Atlantic  and  Wall Street Journal  , for example — about his opposition to euthanasia and his belief in appropriate end-of-life care. Here's a quote from a Jan. 7, 1997, commentary written by Emanuel for the  Wall Street Journal  : """"For the millions of others, legalizing euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide would be of no benefit. To the contrary, it would be a way of avoiding the complex and arduous efforts required of doctors and other health-care providers to ensure that dying patients receive humane, dignified care."""" There's no question Emanuel has written some things that some would consider controversial. For example, in another paper cited by McCaughey, a June 18, 2008 commentary for the  Journal of the American Medical Association  , Emanuel talks about how overutilization of health care is the most important contributor to the cost of health care in America. He takes aim at a medical culture that rewards """"meticulousness, not effectiveness"""" and leads to a mindset in which doctors view it as """"imperative to do everything for the patient regardless of cost or effect on others."""" He concludes that in order to rein in costs, we ought to """"devise financial incentives for physicians and patients that result in greater health care value."""" Those kinds of opinions are fair game for political debate. And we certainly think it's fair to question where such ideas might lead in a practical sense. Emanuel is a key health care adviser. But to make the sensational claim that Emanuel says health care should not be extended to the disabled is a gross distortion of his position, lifted out of context from an academic paper in which he poses philosophical ideas but doesn't necessary endorse them. Emanuel's hefty medical record also counts for something, as well his unequivocal public position against euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide. We rule Bachmann's statement .""","http://www.bioethics.nih.gov/people/emanuel-bio.shtml, https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199703/euthanasia, https://www.nypost.com/seven/07242009/postopinion/opedcolumnists/deadly_doctors_180941.htm, http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/07/when-academic-words-become-political-ammunition-.html, http://www.c-spanarchives.org/congress/?q=node/77531&id=9022203, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CHBvKGmevI",false,"National, Health Care, Michele Bachmann, "

There is still no vaccine or medical treatment for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus.,Emily Venezky,"""The Novel Coronavirus has been surrounded by panic and misinformation since its discovery in December 2019. The most recent false claim is that cocaine is the cure. Images of breaking news stories claiming that cocaine is the newest remedy to coronavirus are being reposted on Twitter and Facebook. One Facebook post from Jan. 30 included an image of a bag of cocaine in the background of a news banner that says """"Cocaine kills corona virus"""" and """"Scientists is shocked to discover that this drug can fight the virus."""" No, this grammatically challenged image was not from a real breaking news alert. This image is made by an online news generator. There is still no cure for the coronavirus. This post was flagged by Facebook as part of efforts to combat false news and information on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The breaking news format of this social media claim came from a website that allows you to create your own breaking news stories by uploading your own image and headline into a generator. The waterstamp """"breakyourownnews.com"""" in the top right corner is blurred out in the Facebook post. In the original image of the bag of cocaine, which can be found on multiple stock image sites, there was no blurry white spot in the corner. This breaking news image is fabricated. If there were a cure for the Novel Coronavirus, we wouldn’t count on it being a stimulant like cocaine. Cocaine is a highly addictive drug that can lead to long-term respiratory problems and movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease, according to the National Institutes of Health. In 2017 there were a total of 13,942 drug overdose deaths in the United States that involved cocaine. There have been 1,016 deaths reported worldwide from the coronavirus as of Feb. 10, none in the United States. We wouldn’t recommend trying a highly addictive drug in hopes of fighting off a viral disease.""","https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus&variant=show&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storyline_menu, https://stock.adobe.com/198397172?as_campaign=TinEye&as_content=similar&epi1=198397172&tduid=1f0375c477d1a8fa8b013ec08435feeb&as_channel=affiliate&as_campclass=redirect&as_source=arvato, https://breakyourownnews.com/, https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/cocaine, https://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-233511877/stock-photo-mans-hand-holding-on-palm-plastic-packet-with-cocaine-powder-or-another-drugs-drug-dealer-proposes, https://twitter.com/bizzleosikoya/status/1224305371356987392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1224305371356987392&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ghgossip.com%2Fcocaine-kills-coronavirus-social-media-user-tweets%2F, https://www.facebook.com/2585076391537421/photos/a.2589308767780850/3254889974556056/?type=3&theater, https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6817a3.htm, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html, https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/mans-hand-holding-on-palm-plastic-packet-with-cocaine-powder-or-another-drugs-drug-gm939841150-256951370, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html",false,"Public Health, Facebook Fact-checks, Coronavirus, Facebook posts, "
